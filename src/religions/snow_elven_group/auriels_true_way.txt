The chief deity of the Aldmeri pantheons, worship of Auri-El has been found across Tamriel from the Ayleids, to the Altmer, and even Falmer. It is believed that he taught the Aldmer to carry themselves with dignity while they suffer upon Nirn and how they may follow in his steps to escape the mortal plane.
At the dawn of the first Era, the Cult of Auri-El has long served as the primary faith of the Falmer and in these dire times after the First Elven-Nordic War it has eclipsed the other Aedric Cults."
