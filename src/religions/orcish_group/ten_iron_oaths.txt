Even though they swore ten so called iron oaths on them. The reason for this is that their duraki neighbors with which they lived long in harmony started attacking them thus forcing them to dig the earth for metals in order to forge weapons. Ever since the iron orcs are a warlusting malevolent people. They hate themselves for desecrating their sacred stones and project this hatred on everyone else."
