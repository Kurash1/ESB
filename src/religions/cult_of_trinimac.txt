Trinimac was Auri-El’s great knight and has long served as a symbol of inspiration for the more warlike of the Mer who’ve long honoured strength, combat, and bravery. It was Trinimac who tore Lorkhan’s heart from his chest; it was during the Merethic Era that worship of the Paragon was at its apex. During the late Merethic Era, it is believed that Trinimac was defeated and destroyed by the Daedric Prince Boethiah. Which has long led to a decline of his faith.
By the dawn of the first Era, the Cult of Trinimac has long faded into obscurity; however, more militant Falmer in southern Skyrim remain. "
