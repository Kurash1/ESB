According to Nordic tradition, after the Five Hundred Companions disbanded, the Ylgermet's crew stumbled upon the barrow of Yngol, Ysgramor's son. When Ysgramor looked south and saw where the White River flowed into the Sea of Ghosts, he decreed that a great city should be built there to serve as a monument to the glories of mankind, a place from where he could gaze upon the hill of Yngol's barrow, and a gateway to guard Skyrim's interior against incursion via the river."

After the disbanding of the Five Hundred Companions, Ysgramor would reencounter Yngol Barrow and decreed that a great city should be built near by in order that he have a view of the barrow from his seat of power."
