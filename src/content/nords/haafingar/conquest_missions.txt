			Our advisors of the blue palace propose multiple differing opinions on the issue:

			[Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] our military advisor suggests that the city should be focused on studying the ways of war, protected by the steed, we can turn it into the ultimate training grounds.
			[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] our administrative advisor, on the other hand, proposes that the city should be focused on the manufacturing of the means of war, weapons.

However we have yet to decide upon the focus of the settlement, so the court of the blue palace has been once again called.

'Twin Dragons overlooking river, A waterfall just to the south, and ambiance of calm waves. It is destined to become a city of poetry I say.' [Root.bards_college_advisor.GetName] an advisor from the bards college says, but is quickly silenced by [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] our military advisor who calls it 'Poetic nonsense' [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] instead says that we should focus on the Four Shields Order of the original town, a band of mercenaries from there, who held some renown in the past, but now have fallen. With our sponsorship we could revitalize the mercenaries of Dragon Bridge.

'The Dragon skulls may look pretty and all, but they hide a sinister shadow, beneath the city is a den of thieves that is ever growing in influence' [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] our administrative advisor warns, but then adds to it 'Well of course if we were to make some dealings with them we might be able to use them on our enemies instead, while keeping damage to ourselves at a minimu-' [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] is interrupted as the court shakes '§RHi al zin do dovah miraad fah faraan§!' [Root.blue_palace_tongue.GetName] the tongue continues further 'No this is a perfect opportunity to purge all corruption from the realm, let us found a scaled justice that defends the realm from thieves.'

And finally [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] our diplomatic advisor suggests 'Wasn't the reason the city become prominent because it's on an important trade route? I think we should focus on that.'"
