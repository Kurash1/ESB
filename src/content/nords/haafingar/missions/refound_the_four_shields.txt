These four brothers built the original town right next to the Dragon Bridge which had been before feared by the locals, and they taught the locals their skills of war, that they had learnt in Atmora, even after their passing their legacy continued, as mercenary after mercenary taught the teachings of the Four Shields, and it formed into a full company. This Company was unfortunately destroyed in the §YWar of the Twin Bridges§!, but through our sponsorship we could refound it."
