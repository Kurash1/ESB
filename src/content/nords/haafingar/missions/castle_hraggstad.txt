The blessing of the steed is a blessing of war, and thus we built a fort next to the stone, but now that fort has become a mighty fortress city, and the question comes, what should this city focus on?

Our advisors of the blue palace propose multiple differing opinions on the issue:

[Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] our military advisor suggests that the city should be focused on studying the ways of war, protected by the steed, we can turn it into the ultimate training grounds.
[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] our administrative advisor, on the other hand, proposes that the city should be focused on the manufacturing of the means of war, weapons.
While a third voice shakes the court, 'Thur-do-ahrol-moro, Ahrk faal lahvu do lovaas key.' one of the mightiest tongues of our realm suggest that he would make a special force there, in resemblance to the fate-stone."
