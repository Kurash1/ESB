Ormil, the publican of the Bloated Float Inn in the Waterfront district of the Imperial City, spread a false rumor that he held this famous statue on his water-bound inn to increase business. This attracted the Blackwater Brigands, who vowed to obtain the Golden Galleon, fence it, and split the profit four ways. To accomplish this the Brigands hijacked the Bloated Float, held the publican and his bouncer hostage, and set off to sea to search for the treasure in peace and security. Little did they know that the Champion of Cyrodiil was asleep in the hold when they set off, and would awaken to foil their plan. The adventurer systematically killed the Brigands and freed Ormil and the bouncer, Graman gro-Marad. The only rumored survivor was Selene, leader of the Brigands, who surrendered the Blackwater Blade to the Champion and was incarcerated for her crimes shortly after the Bloated Float returned to the Waterfront."

Other known effects include causing a weakness to frost, or temporary paralysis. It also repairs itself when the wielder takes frost damage. The sword's first known owner was Valus Odiil, an Imperial adventurer who wandered Tamriel (or at least Hammerfell). Valus eventually settled down in Cyrodiil, and bought a farm outside the walls of Chorrol. However, his farm was continuously raided by goblins from the Great Forest, and the town guard refused to help. In 3E 433, unable to fight in his old age, he asked the Champion of Cyrodiil to aid his two sons in killing the goblins. After the battle, Valus passed on Chillrend to the Champion for keeping his sons safe, saying that he was going to spend the rest of his days in peace."

Disgruntled, the society hired a mercenary to investigate the source of Thorinor's merchandise, which they suspected was gotten by illicit means. The investigation led to the acquisition of evidence that revealed that Thorinor's dealer was not a simple trapper, but a Nordic grave digger named Agarmir. His journal revealed that he dug the graves of the wealthy in cities all across Cyrodiil. One of the items of note was the Debaser itself, taken from the resting place of a Oford Gabings from Anvil. After confronting Thorinor about his dealer, he revealed that he had no idea where Agarmir got his goods, and led the mercenary to the direction the Nord was planning to be. In reality, the gravedigger set a trap, and attempted to slay the interloper, but was put down. With the dealer gone, Thorinor joined the Society of Concerned Merchants, and donated his ill-gotten goods and the gold obtained from their sale to the Temple, thus eluding the wrath of the Imperial Watch, and helped re-stabilize the economy. Despite the Debaser being gained by gravedigging, it was kept by the Mercenary, with no efforts made to retrieve it by the Imperial Watch."

Reman Cyrodiil decided to unify them and form an army to repel the Akaviri raiders. The force became known as the Army of Reman. The two armies clashed in what's now northern Cyrodiil. The Akaviri were strong and well supplied. But their greatest error was marching through Morrowind on the way to their objective and dismissing the response it would garner from Vivec. They didn't count on Lord Vivec forming an alliance with the Trident-Kings of the Dreugh. From Morrowind, he struck at their rear flank. Not only did this make the Akaviri fight on two fronts, it also cut off access to reinforcements and supplies from the sea."
