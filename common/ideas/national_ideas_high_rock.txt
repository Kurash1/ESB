	# Adamantine Tower
	# Acording to historical lore of the Dawn and Merethic Eras, the Direnni Tower was created by the Aedra as a place for discussing the creation of Mundus.

	# After you have played the game for a while, you will start to notice patterns to the dungeons. This is a by-product of the dungeon creation process. Daggerfall dungeons are modular. The Main Quest dungeons were painstakingly constructed by hand, but the random dungeons take pieces of the Main Quest dungeons (and other pieces) and sling them together in random forms. This is why players get a strange sense of "deja vu" in the random dungeons. They really have been here before. Once you reach this point, finding quest objects becomes much easier because each module only has one or two object locations.

	# Breton Society
	# Bretons are a human race of elven ancestry that inhabits High Rock. They are united in culture and language, but divided politically, for High Rock is fractious. Bretons make up the peasantry, soldiery, and magical elite of the feudal kingdoms competing for power within High Rock. Bretons are known for their intelligence and have a quick and perceptive grasp of spellcraft, enchantment, and alchemy. Even the humblest of Bretons can boast a high resistance to destructive and dominating magical energies.

The Bretons would not remain united, and went back to fighting one another, and those outside of High Rock, until they had to unite when the Nords reclaimed their land in the War of Bend'r-Mahk, when they fought the Redguards in the War of Betony, and when the Orcs resurrected Orsinium. However they would be united in The Miracle of Peace. "The 'Miracle of Peace' is celebrated as the product of the miraculous interventions of Stendarr, Mara, and Akatosh to transform this troublesome region into peaceful, well-governed Imperial counties. This event transformed High Rock from numerous city-states into five kingdoms.

	# Feudal Overlords
	# The Direnni didn't enslave the Nedes as the Ayleids of Cyrodiil did; instead, they ruled them as a noble caste. The elves established a system of feudal vassalage over their new subjects and took Nedic concubines. They inevitably interbred with their human subjects, producing half-elven children. The children begat from these unions weren't adopted by their Direnni parents, as they were considered sub-mer. Instead, they were given privileged positions among the Nedes, which eventually lead to a recognizable mixed-blood human caste dubbed "Bretons", from the Ehlnofex "beratu", meaning "half". These Bretons were only allowed to marry humans. Over time, their elven blood thinned, and their human features became more prominent.

In the Middle Merethic Era, Clan Direnni rediscovered and captured the Adamantine Tower. Some believe the Direnni were following their destiny to rule from Balfiera, while others believed that the clan was exiled.

Using his knowledge of alchemy, Asliel Direnni poisoned a barbarian tribe called the Locvar that were continuously raiding Tyrigel. With this external threat dealt with, the way was paved for the future prosperity of the Direnni farms, and generations later they would leave Summerset and travel to mainland Tamriel which would further increase their power and influence.

	# Thoroughly spent, the Direnni eventually retreated to Balfiera. Most of High Rock would be under Breton control by 1E 498, though the elves would be accepted and allowed to remain in the province for most of the Second Era. The Bretons' rise to prominence in High Rock initially started through villages being founded in tactical locations, such as Wayrest, which started as a fishing hamlet. Nordic cities such as Camlorn became Breton due to assimilation from the growing Breton population as opposed to conquest. Over time, the emerging Bretons absorbed the remaining Nordic population in High Rock, and the land would be definitively Breton by the end of the First Era.

During the battle, Durcorach was slain by Emeric of Cumberland, and his banner was torn. This was a fatal blow to the Reachmen, and soon, the Knights of the Dragon under King Bergamot finished what the Dragoons had begun, scattering the remnants of Durcorach's army.

	# Orc-City
	# Orsinium (which literally translates to "Orc-Town" in Aldmeris) is the city of the Orsimer and the provincial seat of the region of Wrothgar, which came to be known as the Orsinium Area in the late Third Era. It has been sacked and rebuilt many times over the centuries, as the Orcs are often at odds with their Breton and Redguard neighbors. Orsinium was first built in High Rock, straddling the boundary between western Wrothgar and Rivenspire. In the mid-Second Era, the city was relocated to eastern Wrothgar. In 3E 399, it was relocated again to a site between Wayrest, Menevia, and the Wrothgarian Mountains. By 4E 201, Orsinium had been moved a third time, farther south to an area between Hammerfell and Skyrim.

	# Unified Nation
	# After the transformation of the Orsimer deity known as Trinimac into the Daedric Prince Malacath, the Orcs, who transformed as well, fled to the northern wastes, near Saarthal. After hundreds of orcs, ogres, goblins, gremlins and other beastfolk were set free by the Altmer during the Camoran Dynasty, they chose to settle in an uninhabited mountain region close to Old Hroldan in High Rock, as their people were dependent on a rare, shaggy, giant centipede herd-beast that can only survive at high altitudes. In the tenth century of the First Era, chieftain Torug gro-Igron brought the Orcish people together and founded a village in the western Wrothgarian Mountains. Thanks to the cooperation of several Orcish clans, particularly Igrun, Morkul, Shatul, and Tumnosh, the village quickly grew into a great stone city. The first Orsinium drew the Orcs by its magnificence and Torug's vision of a united Orc nation.

	# Gortwog
	# At some point later, the Orcs again lost control of Orsinium. The land was then won back by the Orc hero Gortwog gro-Nagorm in 3E 399, who was disputing claim on the land, made by the Breton noble Lord Bowyn. Gortwog won the land by defeating Lord Bowyn in a duel. Named Nova Orsinium, the city was rebuilt on a mountainside between Menevia and Wayrest, at the site of Torug's original Orsinium. As the city harbored statues of Orc heroes such as Mauloch and Torug, and was built of iron, it was likely that Nova Orsinium would provoke the same reaction from its neighboring kingdoms as the first city did. However, the land prospered, as Gortwog proved to be a diplomatic as well as a political genius. Following the events of the Miracle of Peace, Gortwog used the Numidium to conquer substantial territory of central High Rock. Its application for elevation to Provincial status, which was proposed to Tiber Septim at the founding of the Third Empire, was finally beginning to be reviewed by Emperor Uriel Septim VII.

Chief Yashnag gro-Yazgu in particular succeeded in carving out a chiefdom in western Falkreath that persisted until 2E 467, when Yashnag and his champions were slain by Hakkvild Yashnag-Slayer, the Jarl of Falkreath, in a ritual of single-combat.

	# Pelin Veneration

He had become a folk hero to the Bretons of Evermore and the greater region of Bretonic-Bangkorai, memorialized by the chapel of St. Pelin in Evermore, the Order of Saint Pelin, the knightly order of the Kingdom of Evermore, and the great cemetery called Pelin Graveyard.

	# Bangkorai
	# Many times throughout history, the soldiers of the Bangkorai Garrison have successfully stopped invaders from pouring through the Bangkorai Pass, protecting the lands beyond it from military conquest. In 1E 874, a horde of Orcs and goblins which had been displaced by the Redguards flowed west, but were denied passage at the Bangkorai Pass. They were forced to head northeast into the Dragontail Mountains in order to reach Orsinium. Then, in 1E 1029, when the Imperial Legion under Empress Hestra deposed King Styriche, the Vampire of Verkarth, he and his Gray Host fled west, burning and killing as they came, but were successfully stopped and routed at the Pass.
