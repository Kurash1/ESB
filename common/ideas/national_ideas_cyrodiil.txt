A Dragon Break is a phenomenon where linear time is broken, and becomes non-linear. The "Dragon" refers to Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time. A Dragon Break not only precedes significant changes in Tamriel, but challenges mortal comprehension.

They left many influences on Imperial institutions and culture, including the doctrines and equipment of the Imperial Legion, the creation of the Akaviri Dragonguard (a personal bodyguard organisation for the Emperor) and Fighters Guild, a reverence among the Imperial aristocracy for all things Akaviri, and the adoption of the dragon as a symbol of the Empire.[Note 3] A number of Tsaesci even served the Second Empire as Potentates, among them Sidri-Ashak, Versidue-Shaie, and Savirien-Chorak. The latter two ruled the Second Empire outright during the first half of the Second Era, a period known as the Akaviri Potentate that was brought on by the demise of the Reman Dynasty.

	# Akatosh Chivalry
	# The Order of the Hour is one of the oldest knightly orders in the Empire. It was born early in the life of the Empire, during the First Era, and eventually faded into obscurity during the Second Era. It was founded by Ennon Decan as an order of knights dedicated to Akatosh, though originally it drew its members from the priesthood and military alike. The most recent incarnation of the Order of the Hour was established in 2E 432 by the warrior-priest of Akatosh, Cavor Merula, in response to the collapse of the Second Empire and the coming of the Longhouse Emperors. Fearing for the safety of the Dragon God priesthood and wanting to protect the Cathedral of Akatosh and its many historic and religiously significant treasures, Cavor gathered a few devoted and trusted fellow priests and dedicated himself and his brothers to the defense of the Cathedral. On that day, the Order of the Hour was reborn.

Both the city and its ruler came to be regarded within the Ayleid Empire as the beacons of the west, and Meridia demonstrated her favor by granting Garlas Malatar the Guiding Light, a beacon powered by her light that shone above the city for miles around. Under King Narilmor's reign, Garlas Malatar thrived as a cosmopolitan port city and major trading hub.

	# A very rare plant that grows near water. It gives off a low hum when nearby and has amazing magical potential. Originally yellow-leaved, the plant mutated drastically during the Sun's Death event of 1E 668. Due to its magical nature, it sensed as a species its impending extinction and used the ash salts found falling from the sky as a new source of food. This allowed the plant to live without sunlight. As the ash content of Cyrodiil's soils diminished, so too did the plant's numbers and it is once again on the brink of extinction.
