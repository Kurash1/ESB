	# Camoran Dynasty
	# The Camoran Dynasty was an aristocratic dynasty that ruled Valenwood for much of its history. One of the earliest known dynasties in Tamriel, its founding by King Eplear is an event traditionally regarded as the beginning of Year Zero of the First Era. Eplear's success in uniting the inherently wild Bosmer has been argued to be one of the greatest military feats in Tamriel's history. The Camorans remained in power for centuries afterwards, even resisting the aggressive expansion of the Alessian Empire, until Valenwood was conquered by the Second Empire in 1E 2714 following years of unrelenting warfare and the devastation of the Thrassian Plague. The Camoran Dynasty survived, but the Empire broke its influence by granting independence to Valenwood's lesser nobles.

	# Elden Tree
	# The Elden Tree is an even larger sub-species of the graht-oak and one of the oldest living things in all of Tamriel. They are generally worshipped as focal points of the Green's essence. The cities, Elden Root and Falinesti are the only settlements built from the Elden Tree.

	# Across the base of the tree is an intricate network of platforms, held together by thick vines and operated by ferrymen. They transport people across the city, from the ground floor to other districts across Falinesti. Despite where the seasonal sites are located, Falinesti has a port and it was one of the most significant stops in southwest Tamriel. One of these districts is called Havel Slump, located in the lower boughs of the tree. The streets are narrow but solid, as the book, "A Dance in Fire" explains, like the marble of the Imperial City. Curled webs of moss hang unevenly over the streets, forming a shared roof for several dozen small buildings.

	# Greenspeaker Architecture
	# The Greenspeakers are Bosmeri practitioners of nature magic who work in tandem with the Green Pact to shape the environment into settlements such as villages and even cities. They enhance the growth of Graht-oak trees and branches to form furniture, weapons, and even housing called Pod-Homes. They also craft it into bridges and platforms, as well as gates and large temples. The Falinesti were considered the greatest greenspeakers in history and their end goal was to create the perfect fusion of city and forest, which led to the creation of modern-day Falinesti.

	# Pragmatism Above Zealotry
	# Despite its perceived simplicity the Green Pact's doctrinal details can be baffling to outsiders, its certain aspects are often matters of dispute among the Bosmer. Picking up and consumption fallen fruits is not considered breach of Green Pact. Dairy products, honey, mushrooms, and insects are generally accepted meals in the Valenwood and eating them is not considered breach of the Green Pact by all but the most ultra-zealous of Pact Bosmer. Green Pact Bosmer are said to attack any who would harm the forest in which they live, which they call the Green. However, they usually don't mind other races cutting trees down (most notably in the case of Vinedusk Rangers and Wood Orcs in their respective territories), and are known to buy wood from them.

The forms they take are not static, however, as they may appear like a serpent one moment, and shift into another creature the next moment. When Bosmer invoke the Wild Hunt, it causes a change in wild animals as well. Beasts typically transform into beings that are part plant and part animal. The purpose of the Wild Hunt varies with each separate Hunt, from an act of vengeance to a tool of war. In either case, the Bosmer are not proud of their ability and are unwilling to discuss the Hunt at great length. One of the rare accounts on the nature of the Wild Hunt states that "every monster in the world that has ever been comes from a previous Hunt". As such, the Bosmer are reluctant to use the Hunt, except as an act of desperation.

	# Unlike their neighbors, the Wood Orcs do not adhere to the Green Pact and are free to exploit the environment, much to the dismay of the Bosmer. However, this brings a lot of business opportunities for these races, for example, the Wood Orcs main source of trade was from mining coal and kindlepitch, and selling to the Bosmer who cannot exploit the landscape in the same way, but still need fuel for their fires. Not to mention, the Wood Orcs are just as good at smithing than their northern cousins, so most, if not all of the Bosmer's metal tools and weapons comes from the Wood Orcs.

That pride and that belief betrayed them in Abamath. When Ayleid forces arrived at the Wood Orc town, the warriors painted themselves in the "blood of Malacath" and relied on their shamans' magic to protect them from the invaders. They stood strong and held. And then they broke. And died. And some few fled—a shame that haunts their descendants. The Ayleids took Abamath and turned it into their own demesne. The Wood Orcs remember their defeat and have turned it into a rallying cry. Many Wood Orcs—especially those who trace their ancestry back to the taking of Abamath—paint their faces red still, hoping to cleanse their shame with displays of renewed ferocity.

And across the land, from tavern to tavern, Faltonia's Promise had become nothing more than a punchline of a failed dream. But Salvius was not willing to give, and instead turned her town into a quarry-town. Faltonia Salvius was able to negotiate with the port-city of Haven, to supply the stone for their ruined buildings. But these changed when a charismatic Altmer Canonreeve persuaded Haven to build with imported Summerset stone. With essentially no money left, Faltonia Salvius had abandoned her settlement and those that came to seek wealth had spread across Grahtwood. From then on, Faltonia's Promise had become known as Goldfolly.

Because they lived only on the slenderest branches of the trees, and only on the ends of those same branches, the Imga had to climb beneath them and jump up to "pick" the Kollopi from their perches. Imga are, of course, naturally dexterous, but I was then relatively young and spry, and they let me help them. While I could never jump as high they could, with practice, I found that if I kept my head and upper body rigid, and launched off the ground with a scissors-like kick, I could reach the Kollopi on the lowest branches of the tree. I believe I gathered three Kollopi myself, though with considerable effort.

The look of the crown along with his elusiveness caused him to be depicted as an Altmer with antlers. He is as much a political figurehead as a god, as these tribes answer to him rather than the King in Elden Root. The Wilderking is selective of those he appears to, which often causes outsiders to doubt his existence.

While viewed by outsiders as a title for the Bosmer's political representative for foreign affairs, the Silvenar is more than a mere politician. Each person who bears the title is thought of as merely the Silvenar's aspect. The Silvenar represents the Bosmer people legally, physically, and emotionally. He is said to be their spirituality, in contrast to the Green Lady, who is their physicality. It is said to be the union of the two that makes Valenwood whole. He is inseparably tied to the Bosmeri people, and they to him, making him supernaturally empathic and aware of their concerns. They also believe that he looks after their spirits, as well as their bodies. As the Voice of the People, the Silvenar has many rights which grant him great authority in Valenwood. For one, only the Silvenar can grant foreign building and trade contracts, meaning any which wishes to build in Valenwood or do business with the Bosmer must deal with the Silvenar first.

From the interplay of the manifold Green-Sap, the Bosmer learned the songs which "made the trees dance", and which dances they desired to perform. In other words, each Green-Sap was able to sing their own song, tell their own story — create their own reality. And the Bosmer took joy in this, and in picking the song which appealed to them, as it was a reflection of their own nature.

There are bridges of amber and Silvenar's architecture is sometimes described as "petrified."
