	# First Dragonborn
	# Miraak, which means "Allegiance Guide" in the dragon language, was originally a Dragon Priest in the Merethic Era. He is the First Dragonborn, although that term would not become used until after the time of St. Alessia, the first Dragonborn recorded in history. He ruled over the island of Solstheim, where a large temple was dedicated to him.

Using this knowledge and his innate ability to devour the souls of dragonkind, he turned on his winged overlords and killed a great number of them.
