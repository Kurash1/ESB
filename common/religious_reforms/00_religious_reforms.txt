# serpent_king_reforms:0 "Serpent King's Reforms"
# serpent_king_reform_1:0 "Open up Sumptuary Restrictions"
# serpent_king_reform_1_desc:0 "Our society has traditionally restricted the use of finer clothing, jewelry or even the amount of stories a house may have to the hereditary nobility. By opening up these perks to anyone who performs well on the field of battle we can create a state where every member of our society is ready to do their part in times of war."
# serpent_king_reform_2:0 "Extend Merchant Obligations"
# serpent_king_reform_2_desc:0 "The trade guilds have often come to act as our emissaries, diplomats and spies in relations with other countries. Let us formalize this relationship into a set of strict obligations to more efficiently handle our foreign relations."
# serpent_king_reform_3:0 "Warrior Ranks"
# serpent_king_reform_3_desc:0 "By creating a system of ranks dependent on how many captives a warrior has taken during his career we can encourage each warrior in our armies to strive towards constantly improving his skills."
# serpent_king_reform_4:0 "Tribal Expansion"
# serpent_king_reform_4_desc:0 "The lands around us are dominated by disorganized tribes. By sending groups of settlers and soldiers into these areas we can expand our state even into these desolate areas."
# serpent_king_reform_5:0 "Legal Reform"
# serpent_king_reform_5_desc:0 "Until now the city states under our control have all had their respective legal systems controlled by their own respective judges. Let us create a set of central laws that need to apply throughout our state and start educating judges centrally."

# kamal_reform_1_desc:0 "While our subject peoples have always supplied troops for our armies they have done so to varying degrees. By formalizing the need for every subjugated area to supply soldiers to the central state we will be able to tap the manpower resources of our lands in a much more efficient manner."
# kamal_reform_2:0 "Expanded Resettlement Policy"
# kamal_reform_2_desc:0 "The policy of moving entire villages from loyal areas into newly conquered land or into the frontier has helped expand the state. This type of forced resettlement could also be used to resettle the population of newly conquered areas into the core parts of the empire. Strict laws should be put in place to forbid people from returning to their original homes."
# kamal_reform_3:0 "Reform the Cult of Sun"
# kamal_reform_3_desc:0 "While the Sun is the foremost of all gods most of the peoples in our nation also worship a variety of other minor deities. We must require all corners of our empire to acknowledge the Sun as their main god and that all other idols are given to be kept by our ruler as Sun's foremost representative."
# kamal_reform_4:0 "State Lords"
# kamal_reform_4_desc:0 "By moving away from the hereditary or local powerholders as the commanders of our armies we can instead promote a new class of leaders appointed directly by the state. Selected for their personal merit and loyalty this will ensure that our armies are always led by the fiercest supporters of our state."
# kamal_reform_5:0 "Reform the Bureaucracy"
# kamal_reform_5_desc:0 "In order to facilitate the rapid expansion of our empire it is necessary to create a new class of administrators to oversee everything from the construction of bridges and roads in newly acquired areas to the constant inspection of the regions already under our control."

While we can command the forces of all of these cities they are at the same time acting independently of each other and are paid for by their respective home cities. A unified army structure would ensure that less resources are wasted."
# tang_mo_reform_2:0 "Central Arbitration"
# tang_mo_reform_2_desc:0 "While they are unified under our rule, the city states of our empire frequently get into conflict with each other over everything from trade rights to border demarcation. By creating a central arbitration authority we can greatly reduce these tensions."
# tang_mo_reform_3:0 "Central Armories"
# tang_mo_reform_3_desc:0 "In times of war it has been customary for the city states of Thousand Isalnds to arm the commoners in order to raise armies big enough to challenge their neighbors or the Ice Demons. As each state has its own armories the type and quality of arms can vary a lot within the empire. By creating a central system of armories from which all armies are equipped we can drastically increase the quality of our armed forces."
