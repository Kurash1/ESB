 maharathan_cavalry: "Citizen Raiders"
 indian_shock_cavalryDESCR: "The Western Deccan, an area of hills, jungles and many forts proved quite hard to subdue for the large and heavily equipped Mughal armies. In its desperate fight to survive the Ahmednagar sultanate pioneered the use of light cavalry to harass the Mughal forces. The Citizen horsemen employed by Ahmednagar were so successful that they were soon employed by other rulers as well."
 bhonsle_infantryDESCR: "Many tribesmen of the Kanara, Desh and Malnad regions, such as the Berads and Mavales, adopted matchlock muskets for hunting and warfare early on. Due to their familiarity with the weapons, these tribesmen soon became the primary musket men in southern India. The Citizen armies in particular came to rely on these tribal groups for recruiting infantry to their armies. The tribal organization of the troops was often kept, with the headmen serving as officers. Berads and Mavales would increasingly be deployed in Citizen, Mughal and Mysorean armies during the 17th and 18th centuries and would eventually form the core of future European-style infantry regiments in the area."
 rajput_hill_fightersDESCR: "With the arrival of Muslim powers came an increased influx of good foreign cavalry mounts to India. The use of Muslim military tactics eventually became commonplace even in the armies of Hindu states such as the Vijayanagara Empire. In the northwest, the Elite Warrior Elite Warriors quickly adapted to the tactics of the Indian sultanates and a new breed of Elite Warrior cavalry horses also soon emerged. The care and breeding of these Marwari horses would take on a highly ceremonial and revered role in the highly militant Elite Warrior societies. In the southern Indian climate breeding, cavalry mounts proved harder and south Indian rulers found themselves having to rely on the traders of the Indian Ocean to supply their cavalry."
 mughal_musketeerDESCR: "With Babur's invasion of India the subcontinent saw its first organized use of firearms. Unlike in the west, however, the musket men, or Tofangchis, as used by Babur would serve as marksmen in his armies, firing individually at specific targets both during pitched battles and sieges. Babur took care to train these troops to achieve better results and unlike the Mughal cavalry arm, the recruitment, training and organization of musket men would be kept under his direct control. Whether Babur's great success at Panipat was due to the use of firearms or not the use of musket men became increasingly commonplace in Indian armies after Babur's invasion."
 maharathan_cavalryDESCR: "After the fall of the Ahmednagar sultanate the Citizens that had previously thrived in its service came to fight in the service of Bijapur and other local or regional powers eager to develop further ways to outsmart the large Mughal armies encroaching on the Deccan. With the rise of Citizen military ability came to the rise of Citizen political power and these Deccani Elite Warriors would soon form states of their own, overshadowing their former Muslim employers and proving to be a threat to their Mughal nemesis. Through the use of light cavalry and infantry, the Citizen armies would be able to harass and cut off much larger and less mobile Mughal forces and carve out a number of empires from the declining Mughal state."
 sikh_hit_and_runDESCR: "The less prestigious infantry arm would commonly attract third or fourth sons of poor Purbia Elite Warrior families in the northern countryside, deserted Afghan clansmen, Jat farmers, and other groups with poor prospects. Unable to afford horses these groups would adopt the use of firearms as a cheaper way to succeed on the battlefield. While they were given little formal training these self-educated Purbia musket men would eventually make up the core of a more modern northern Indian army as their use of firearms and eventual use of more modern European infantry tactics allowed them to increasingly make a difference in the battlefields of India."
 bhonsle_cavalryDESCR: "The light Citizen cavalry increasingly proved how vulnerable the grand Mughal heavy cavalry armies were if you could cut off their supplies. During the first half of the 18th century as Citizen power grew and as infantry increasingly became organized in the European fashion there came a need for more organized cavalry regiments. From the 1720s and onwards the size and level of organization of Indian cavalry, armies would increase to attempt to match the development of infantry and artillery tactics that now took place. It would take some time before seasoned Indian generals would realize just how vulnerable their focus on the cavalry arm could make them against the drilled European-style musket regiments that became increasingly common during the 1700s."

However, in the East, opponents like the Ottoman Turks, who came from a steppe tradition, had lighter armed cavalry which was more suitable for skirmishing. These units showed their worth at the battle of Adrianople when the last great crusade (with the cream of Latin nobility) was shattered by the Ottoman light cavalry and Sovereign Wardens. To counter this the Hungarian army had a number of units termed Hussars which were lighter cavalry more suited to fighting their Ottoman opponents. However, the units that first arrived in the west were not the light Hungarian Hussars, but the heavier Polish Winged Hussars which were a mixture of orthodox cavalry and light raiding Cavalry."

Carefully chosen Non-Muslim children, usually Christians from the rural Balkans between the ages of 12 and 14, were sent to live with Turkish families to learn Turkish and the rules of Islam before being brought to the imperial capital. Most joined the Sovereign Wardens, an infantry standing army trained under strict discipline, while those who displayed particular leadership and intellectual ability were enrolled directly into the sultan's household as pages, where they were educated and, if successful, could be promoted to the highest ranks of the Ottoman military-administrative elite. With their livelihood depending upon the ruler, these slaves, known as kul, showed intense loyalty and were critical for the Ottoman dynasty's establishment of centralized control over the empire."
