Terrible reports come to us through the ages of beatings, killings, and horrific acts of torture. Their twisted methods were known by such names as 'Wailing Wheels', 'Gut Gardens', and 'Flesh Sculptures'. One shudders to imagine what horrors those acts entailed."
 esb_ayleid_ideas_4: "Meteoric Glass"
 esb_ayleid_ideas_4_desc: "Some time in the Merethic past, Ayleid Sorcerers stumbled upon the innate magical properties of Meteoric Glass - a rare form of Aetherial Fragment. This highly prized material could be fashioned into useful devices such as Welkynd stones, Varla Stones, and several other similar trinkets. A Welkynd Stone served as a font of Magicka from which a mage could replenish their own reserves, while a Varla stone allowed even an inexperienced magic user to recharge enchanted items. The Ayleids were even said to have learned the process of cultivating the glass crystals so that their limited supply could be grown and multiplied, although nothing is known about the methods they used to achieve this."
 esb_ayleid_ideas_5: "Ayleid City-States"
 esb_ayleid_ideas_5_desc: "Cyrodiil (or Cyrod, as it was known to the Ayleids), was once home to dozens of Ayleid cities which were scattered all across the region. Eventually, these cities coalesced into an empire ruled by powerful sorcerer-kings."
 esb_ayleid_ideas_6: "Holy Light"
 esb_ayleid_ideas_6_desc: "The Ayleids believed that Light was the most sacred of the four basic elements (the others being Earth, Water, and Air). In particular, they believed that starlight was a particularly pure and potent form of light, and would build special 'wells' which supposedly captured the power of starlight. Meridia, or Merid-Nunda in Ayleidoon, was accordingly worshipped with special attention due to her association with Light in all of its forms."
 esb_ayleid_ideas_7: "Chim-el Adabal"
 esb_ayleid_ideas_7_desc: "The Ayleids were the builders of the White-Gold tower - one of eight Towers to be found on Tamriel which keep Mundus stabilized, and which was built in imitation of the original Tower known as the Adamantine Tower. The stone of White-Gold - a fiery-red gem in the shape of a diamond - is called Chim-el Adabal, and is thought to be made of a crystallized drop of Lorkhan's blood. The stone was later made into the Amulet of Kings and gifted to Alessia by Akatosh as a symbol of his favour, and to represent the legitimacy of the coming empires of men."

 esb_clannfear_ideas_2: "Defensive Frills and Boneplates"
 esb_clannfear_ideas_2_desc: "The frills that adorn Clannfear necks do not contain much in the way of vitals. They can be hit, pierced, or bashed, only causing slight harm to the Clannfear, preventing more vital areas such as the torso from being harmed.\nIn addition to their frills, Clannfear are also adorned with various protrusions of bone, which can help to catch blades and sharp objects before they can puncture flesh."

 esb_clannfear_ideas_6_desc: "While the Clannfear are not the most intelligent, they are quite capable of picking up on commands and training from other races.

 esb_great_house_ideas_1: "Settled Lifestyle"
 esb_great_house_ideas_1_desc: "The Great Houses emerged as a movement within Ashlander society which had grown to view the traditional ways as outdated, and desired to settle down and build a more modern civilization for themselves. While the Ashlanders continued their nomadic lifestyle, several prominent families who would become the Great Houses began to construct permanent settlements for themselves, which in time grew to become the great political and economic centres of Morrowind such as Balmora, Ald'ruhn, Necrom, and Mournhold."

 esb_great_house_ideas_4: "Great House Rivalries"
 esb_great_house_ideas_4_desc: "Squabbling and feuding amongst each other are one of the most popular Great House pastimes. Infighting between the Great Houses grew to be so rampant that an entire organization of professional (and legal) assassins known as the Morag Tong became a mainstay of Great House life. If you have a grudge against someone, you could legally pay to have them killed. Such an environment led to the Great Houses developing expansive networks of spies to keep tabs on the goings-on of the other houses, lest they catch an assassin's dagger in their sleep. Surprisingly, one of the functions of such a system is to avoid widespread bloodshed; according to legend, Mephala advised the early Great Houses to settle disputes between rulers directly, rather than dragging the rest of their house into a war which would lead to the deaths of others who had no part in the original conflict."
 esb_great_house_ideas_5: "Bonemold Armour"
 esb_great_house_ideas_5_desc: "The Great Houses developed a new type of armour which expanded on the concepts of Ashlander chitin and netch leather armour. Known as \"Bonemold Armour\", it was made from real bone which was treated with a resin and moulded into plating which formed the main protective surfaces of the armour. It was an exceptionally strong and lightweight material, and is favoured by Great House armourers even today."
 esb_great_house_ideas_6: "Ancestral Tombs"
 esb_great_house_ideas_6_desc: "Like the Ashlanders, the Great Houses carried on the ancient tradition of venerating their ancestors.

A particularly common solution to this problem is to maintain some captives (magically or through more traditional means) who are fed off of, but not killed. These \"Thralls\", as they are known, usually fulfil a secondary role as servants and labourers on top of their duties as walking meals."

 esb_xivilai_ideas_2: "Professional Attitude"

 esb_xivilai_ideas_4_desc: "Many Xivilai have another that they are paired with, either having come into being with their pair- making them twins- or simply having met with another Xivilai they can tolerate enough to call their partner.

 esb_xivilai_ideas_7_desc: "Xivilai are known to summon and command other Daedra, such as atronachs and bestial Daedra. While this means they have better control over the Daedra \"below them\", it also means they are able to use those Daedra to keep others in line- such as mortals from Nirn."

 esb_yokudan_ideas_2_desc: "Indeed, perhaps the only thing which can be said to best their naval prowess is the Yokudans' love of the Sword and swordplay. An entire martial tradition is known as \"Sword-singing\" developed out of the Yokudans' desire to end the civil wars which plagued their society. Master sword-singers were known as the \"Ansei\", and are said to have possessed incredible abilities - even the ability to materialize a sword made up of their very soul. Swordsmanship was such an integral part of Yokudan culture that depictions of swords and fighting men can be found on even the most mundane objects in Yokuda."

 esb_argonian_ideas_1_desc: "Tales come to us of an ancient Saxhleel civilization in Black Marsh, predating almost all empires of Man or Mer on Tamriel. These ancient Argonians built cities of huge stone ziggurats known as Xanmeers, mastered various schools of magic, and organized themselves into a complex society of city-states. Curiously, we don't know what caused the decline of this civilization - now known as The Duskfall - as the Argonians themselves have no recollection of it."
 esb_argonian_ideas_2: "Black Marsh"

They are naturally resistant to the myriad diseases that plague (literally) any outsider who dares venture too far from the relatively hospitable coast. Its many hidden coves and inlets also make enticing hideaways for smugglers and bandits."

In the ancient past, during the age of Saxhleel civilization, the Nisswo made up the ruling class - known then as Nisswo-Kings. Apart from the ruling, their duties included the vital task of appeasing Sithis' lust for destruction and chaos, which they achieved through constant sacrifices in his name. Eventually, after undergoing the events of The Duskfall, the Nisswo lost their status as rulers and transitioned into solely filling their priestly roles."

Legend claims that their defence was so furious that they quickly turned back their foe, and even pursued them through the gates back to Oblivion! Their actions forced the Daedra to shut their gates in Black Marsh in order to prevent further casualties, making the Argonians one of the few races to be relatively unharmed by Mehrunes Dagon's invasion."

 esb_bosmer_ideas_3_desc: "Although the Bosmer are very welcoming to strangers and Migrants, placating the Green is a vital part of life in Valenwood, as the forests will often turn against the residents when the Pact is broken or the Valenwood is otherwise harmed. To atone and stop the Green's assault, the clan responsible for that area of land must hold a trial and the party found guilty of violating the Green Pact must be sacrificed to the Green itself, regardless of how limited their involvement was or even whether they were a Bosmer."

Very few have been properly studied before disruption by grave-robbers or greedy adventurers, but those few undisturbed sites have contained a surprising collection of magical objects, such as soul gems, alchemical concoctions, and magical texts. Some scholars take these as evidence that the Dwemer did, in fact, dabble in the magical arts. Based on what we know of their culture, as well as the fact that most arcanex are minor structures compared to other common fixtures, I would suggest that these were centres of study and nothing more. Perhaps the Dwarves established these halls as a means to study Men and Mer, who surely seemed as alien to them as the Dwemer seems to us today.\"\n-Thelwe Ghelein, \"Dwemer Inquiries: Volume II\"\n"

 esb_dwemer_ideas_4: "Tonal Architecture"
 esb_dwemer_ideas_4_desc: "\"At the height of their power, the Dwemer exhibited near-total mastery of tonal forces. Even now, countless centuries later, they remain peerless in this respect. Sound, not magic, facilitated their rise to power. I am continually astounded by tonal forces' wide range of uses. The Dwemer used sound in mining, medicine, architecture—even psychology. It's the latter use that I find most intriguing. According to ancient Chimeri scholarship, the Dwemer could employ tonal forces to bend weaker minds to their will—a form of complex aural hypnosis. Luckily, the Dwarves never managed to mobilize this technology on the battlefield against our august ancestors. The scale and complexity of the devices likely made transportation nearly impossible. But they still managed to employ it on a limited scale using massive devices called Tonal Resonators.\"\n—Vorinara Kleeve, Dwemer Scholar, \"A Guide to Dwemer Mega-Structures\"\n"
