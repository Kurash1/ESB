 DAWN_OF_FIRST_ERA_DESC: "The dawn of the First Era is the sunset of the Merish hegemony in Tamriel. In Valenwood, another war of succession ends, putting a representative of the Camoran Dynasty on a wooden throne. The Ayleids have established their state around the White-Gold Tower. Colonies in Hammerfell have united around Sentinel, the leading city of the Illiac Bay, and defied the rule of the Direnni. Meanwhile, the Falmer continue to lose territory to the Atmorans."

 es_1_scenario.3.d: "The state of mind of the $MONARCH$ always left much to be desired. But now things have worsened considerably. Mood changes occur every hour - sometimes crying while sitting on a throne, then abruptly ordering the execution of a nobleman in the middle of dinner. Now they've decreed that all the country's gold is to be gathered in their bedroom. Royal guards are already raiding various government buildings.

 SECOND_DRAGON_WAR: "Second Dragon War"
 SECOND_DRAGON_WAR_DESC: "Many years have passed since the tyranny of the Dragon Priests was broken. It cost the lives of hundreds of heroes, thousands of warriors who followed them, and tens of thousands of those who did not wait for their return. But the lessons of the past are soon forgotten. People are once more beginning to worship the damned in the hope of gaining power, wealth, or perhaps simply happiness. They have raised mighty priests, restored shrines and temples, and are killing those who protest. It seems a new war is inevitable."
 
 es_2_scenario.1.t: "Rise of Dragon Cult"
 es_2_scenario.1.d: "Years have passed since our brothers and sisters in faith were defeated at the hands of godless barbarians. Our rulers were destroyed, our warriors were killed, and thousands of people were driven into the barren lands of Atmora. But now everything has changed. We rise from the ashes!

 es_2_scenario.5.c: "This is not our war anymore."
 
 es_2_scenario.6.t: "The Wailing Wheel of Vindasel"
 es_2_scenario.6.d: "There can be no barriers for high art, especially when we have so many slaves with amazing, delicate skin that we just want to take off. Of course, the screams of these lower beings can scare away the inexperienced public, as well as the sight of bodies still shuddering in convulsions, appearing to the gaze stripped to meat, without hair, lips or nails. But only by looking at our statues, covered with the freshly removed skin, from which drops of blood are still dripping, one can understand that all this was not in vain. Only one thing saddens our sculptors, that there is no single place where their creations can be exhibited for all to see. Perhaps we could fix this?"
 es_2_scenario.6.a: "We will build an exhibition hall that will go down in the annals of history!"
 es_2_scenario.6.b: "Nothing can beat individual showrooms."
 
 es_2_scenario.7.t: "The Gut-Gardens of Sercen"
 es_2_scenario.7.d: "What could be more attractive than the gaze of a slave, who is shown his insides? Only a tremor in his hands when a piece of liver or lung is put into his palm, which has already turned white from loss of blood. Rumour has it that the masters of art from Sercen can do the same with the heart, however, this performance ends too quickly. What a pity that these people cannot live even one more minute without their wretched pulsating organ! Nevertheless, there is much more to see in the gardens of Sercen, especially if we support this endeavour from our side."
 es_2_scenario.7.a: "This place is a must-visit for everyone!"
 es_2_scenario.7.b: "Are you sure the Daedric Princes approve this?"
 
 es_2_scenario.8.t: "Ceyatatar's Spearmen"
 es_2_scenario.8.d: "The fame of the spearmen of Ceyatatatar has spread throughout Sirodiil. This elite unit has never wavered in any battle it has fought and has always moved into the heart of the enemy, regardless of any losses or other difficulties.  Our generals have been so inspired by their exploits that they propose to expand recruitment to this unit or make training in it mandatory for every one of our infantrymen. Of course, this would involve considerable expense. However, the result is unlikely to be long in coming."
 es_2_scenario.8.a: "Our regiments will be the best!"
 es_2_scenario.8.b: "We can find better usage of demanded resources."
 
 es_2_scenario.9.t: "Goblin Trade"
 es_2_scenario.9.d: "Practice shows that our slaves have a very poor tolerance for hard work in the mines. Certainly, regular processing, together with frequent interruptions in the supply of food, make the likelihood of their rebellion virtually nil. But at the same time, both our growing production and the overseas merchants desperately need an increased supply of various ores and alloys. A possible solution would be to hire free miners, but they would have to be paid every month and also to ensure that their working conditions are respected. So perhaps we should just buy a few hundred goblins from the distant High Rock and send them underground to live in chains?"
 es_2_scenario.9.a: "A bunch of goblin slaves will not hamper our economy."
 es_2_scenario.9.b: "We still need not a temporary solution."
 
 es_2_scenario.10.t: "Slave Raid"
 es_2_scenario.10.d: "As long as slave labour is cheap and efficient, there will always be a demand for new slaves. Fortunately, there are many primitive races around us whose life in chains will not differ much from that of captivity. Here, at least, they will be able to serve for the benefit of [Root.GetName] instead of killing each other for the sake of archaic goals. However, this idea can sometimes be difficult to convey through conventional methods, but the language of power is understood with enviable ease by these savages. Just now we are receiving news of the new slave traders coming to [Root.Capital.GetName] for new goods. Even if the deal fails, we may well be able to replenish our coffers by plundering unprotected settlements. The only question is, are we ready to start the campaign now, or do we need time to prepare?"
 es_2_scenario.10.a: "Order the troops to march immediately!"
 es_2_scenario.10.b: "We have more important things to do than a few trade deals."
 es_2_scenario.11.t: "Successful Raid on [es_slave_raid_target_event_target.GetName] Cities"
 es_2_scenario.11.d: "Our small military intervention on [es_slave_raid_target_event_target.GetName] soil was a huge success. We were able to quickly break the resistance of the troops on the frontier and pushed deep into enemy territory, where we managed to pillage several large towns and capture many slaves, which we managed to extract before the [es_slave_raid_target_event_target.Monarch.GetName]'s army was able to muster the strength to fight us back. The amount of looted gold and the number of captives is so great that some believe that the time has come for a full scale invasion and expansion of our sphere of influence in the lands of [es_slave_raid_target_event_target.GetName]."
 es_2_scenario.11.a: "This will be a quick war!"
 es_2_scenario.11.b: "Those savages does not worth our time."
 es_2_scenario.12.t: "Failed Raid on [es_slave_raid_target_event_target.GetName] Cities"
 es_2_scenario.12.d: "The military intervention in the lands of [es_slave_raid_target_event_target.GetName] was a complete failure. Our troops took too long to cross the border because of the fierce resistance of the [es_slave_raid_target_event_target.Monarch.GetName]'s army and did not manage to reach the rich territories before the main enemy forces approached. The ensuing battle only served to end this war campaign - despite the heroism of our soldiers, they were outnumbered, which resulted in the death of our entire army."
 es_2_scenario.12.a: "This is going to hit our economy..."
 es_2_scenario.13.t: "[es_slave_raid_nation_event_target.GetName] Raids our Cities"
 es_2_scenario.13.d: "The military intervention of [es_slave_raid_nation_event_target.GetName] into our territory was a huge success. They were able to quickly break the resistance of our troops on the frontier and pushed deep into [Root.GetName], where the [es_slave_raid_nation_event_target.Monarch.GetName]'s army pillaged several large towns and captured many slaves. The amount of looted gold and the number of captives was so great that some of enemy generals believe that the time has come for a full scale."
 es_2_scenario.13.a: "We should strike back!"
 es_2_scenario.14.t: "[es_slave_raid_nation_event_target.GetName] Fails to Raid our Cities"
 es_2_scenario.14.d: "The military intervention in the lands of [es_slave_raid_target_event_target.GetName] was a complete failure. The army of [es_slave_raid_nation_event_target.GetName] took too long to cross the border because of the fierce resistance of the [es_slave_raid_target_event_target.Monarch.GetName]'s army and did not manage to delve into our territories. Despite the heroism of their soldiers, they were outnumbered by brave sons and daughters of [Root.GetName], which resulted in the death of the entire enemy army."
 es_2_scenario.14.a: "We have won this battle and we will win the future war!"
 
 es_2_scenario.15.t: "Merchant Caravan"
 es_2_scenario.15.d: "There are tales of riches and unseen goods that are common in foreign countries. Although not all of them are true, there are still those who want to profit from foreign goods. Just now, a group of merchants has come to the Monarch with a request to sponsor their journey to a friendly country, where they hope to purchase local goods to sell here later at double the cost. Of course, such an investment may bring a lot of gold to the treasury, but we should not forget the risks - the roads are full of bandits nowadays, who are not afraid to attack even army convoys. Therefore, we should think twice before handing over state money to these merchants, so that we don't end up with nothing."

Some merchants even managed to spend their profits in local taverns, but many still put some money aside and began to prepare for new journeys. We too, as one of the main investors, are entitled to a share of the profits, but perhaps the main thing is the strengthening of relations between [es_target_of_caraven_event_target.GetName] and [Root.GetName]."

It seems that this journey will not bring us any profit, but the merchants who survived the adventure promise that they will soon prepare a new caravan for departure."

They consider the whole region of Hammerfell to be their legitimate land, which runs counter to the policy of the weakening, but not yet defeated Direnni Hegemony. Meanwhile, in the North, there is still a fragile, but already proven to be effective, an alliance between the Orcs and the goblins. Its goal will be another campaign to the rich lands of the Bretons, who, after several brilliant victories over the greenskins, no longer considered Orsinium a threat to their security.

 es_26_scenario.4.d: "Today at dawn, our brave wars broke the last resistance of the Sloads and captured their capital - the source of the plague. Even though battles in some parts of the city are still ongoing, it is obvious that the collapse of the government of the Sloads and their guild of magicians is already a matter of time. We have already begun the search for a cure for the plague in the flooded laboratories and archives, and we hope that we will find it soon."

Unfortunately, attempts to resolve the contradictions peacefully fail and our once-united culture begins to again fall apart into settled south and nomadic north."

This is an ideal chance for this to subjugate this strategically important region and provide reliable cover for the northern borders of our country. However, it is important to remember that this step can spoil relations with our neighbours, and if we want to concentrate on internal problems, we must withdraw the claims to High Rock and establish good relations with them."

However, the suddenness and seriousness of the epidemic that hit our people does not allow us to provide organized assistance to all victims. Therefore, it seems that we will have to choose who will receive state aid before everyone, and who will have to save on their own. Of course, each faction is ready to reward us for the “right” choice. But it is important to remember that in any case there will be those who are dissatisfied, ready to take up arms."

No one else - neither the neighbours, nor the citizens themselves - has any doubt that the time of theocracy has passed, and that everything possible is possible to take from the dying regime by force or cunning. However, the Order does not intend to give up positions without resistance and the streets of many cities are already drowned in the blood of both the rebels and the government troops.

Unfortunately, due to the total collapse of the army, we were not in a position to restrain the rebels at the gates of the city, and now they are breaking through our barricades to the Palace. It seems that our further resistance in the capital will only lead to even greater losses, and will not be able to prevent the complete capture of the city. Our opponents also understand this, so they offer us to voluntarily lay down their arms and save our lives.

But this is not the worst. Opponents fell into the hands of state archives, which were brought there from all over the country until the current crisis was resolved.

If the situation does not change, then shortly a real war will begin in the region against our regime. However, we can try to prevent this by giving the autonomy of the provinces.

The map of the world has changed beyond recognition - some nations have disappeared from the face of the Nirn, while others have raised their once subjugated heads. Some fractions were replaced by others, while in some places the old religions have given way to new ones. In the centre of Tamriel - in Heartlands - a new Cyrodiil state arose on the ruins of the old.

 es_31_scenario.2.a: "We need to build new roads as soon as possible."
 es_31_scenario.2.b: "These recruits are needed to replenish our troops."
 
 es_31_scenario.3.t: "Tragedy of the Fourth Legion"
 es_31_scenario.3.d: "Unfortunately, based on the latest intelligence reports, we are forced to confirm that the Fourth Legion was completely lost in Black Marsh. It is still difficult for us to indicate the reason for this, since most likely many factors played against us, from unpreparedness for the weather, problems with logistics, and ending with daring attacks by partisans. This is a real tragedy for our entire people, and the army as a whole, which will never be forgotten."
 es_31_scenario.3.a: "We grieve with the whole country."
 
 es_31_scenario.4.t: "Reconstitution of the Fourth Legion"
 es_31_scenario.4.d: "The loss of an entire army is irreparable. However, the war is still ongoing. Therefore, the Elder Council decided to restore the lost legion, headed by General Sardecus, who spent many years in Black Marsh and knows all the hardships of war in the jungle. Crowds of volunteers are already gathering in the capital, ready to avenge the dead sons and daughters of our people."
 es_31_scenario.4.a: "Glory to the Fourth Legion!"
 es_31_scenario.4.b: "Send these people back Home. The war is over."
 
 es_31_scenario.5.t: "Great Burn"
 es_31_scenario.5.d: "A fire rages in Black Marsh, caused by the continuation of hostilities in the region. It seems that someone burned one of the groves, which goes deep into the earth and reaches the underground tunnels located under all the swamps. Many villages have already suffered from the fire, but it does not stop. Even clashes between the Imperials and the Argonians are on the decline. If the situation continues to deteriorate, we will have to start the evacuation of our people from Black Marsh."
 es_31_scenario.5.a: "Disaster!"
 
 es_31_scenario.6.t: "Falco Doctrine"
 es_31_scenario.6.d: "Military operations in Black Marsh have been going on for several decades with varying success. Even though we managed to take control of the main cities, we do not have enough forces to control isolated villages, from where enemy units raid our fortresses. However, one of our generals - Lucinia Falco - proposed a radically new war plan. According to this doctrine, our forces will destroy any resistance together with civilians who are nearby. This should have a devastating effect on the influence of the rebels and force them to retreat into the jungle."
 es_31_scenario.6.a: "Implement this doctrine now!"
 es_31_scenario.6.b: "It is time to end this war, not escalate it."
 
 es_31_scenario.7.t: "Guerrilla War"
 es_31_scenario.7.d: "The war has been going on in Black Marsh for so many years that entire generations grew up in a world where peace was an unattainable goal. The Blackwater war, once launched as a military invasion, grew into guerrilla warfare. Argonians are now hiding in the jungle, delivering their small but painful blows almost every week, paralyzing our infrastructure in the region. These partisan detachments are no longer subordinate to anyone, neither to their former government, who fled the country nor to our new administration. It seems that for a long time we will have to organize raids in the jungle, hoping to catch them all."
 es_31_scenario.7.a: "We will hunt them all down."
 
 es_31_scenario.8.t: "End of Blackwater War"
 es_31_scenario.8.d: "The conquest of Argonia ends. Without a peace treaty, without a final battle at the capital of Black Marsh. Argonians just go home from the jungle. They are tired of all the hardships of war, of the lack of hope for victory and a brighter future. Now life in Black Marsh will never be the same."
 es_31_scenario.8.a: "Every war has its ending."
 
 es_31_scenario.9.t: "Decay of Elven Culture"
 es_31_scenario.9.d: "When a long time ago, elven language and culture dominated Tamriel. However, times are changing. Elven hegemony is a thing of the past. Now the Cyrodiil language is becoming more widespread. Generated by slaves, developed by peasants who had cast off their shackles, approved by the Cyrodiil scholars - all documents are now written in this language and it is spoken in all houses of growing human cities."
 es_31_scenario.9.a: "Will the dawn of the elves ever come again?"
 
 es_31_scenario.10.t: "Embassy from Cyrodiil"
 es_31_scenario.10.d: "Today, an envoy from Cyrodiil named Eric of Guis arrived at our Palace. He has the authority to be the diplomatic representative of the country that was once vassal to us and asks for our permission to open the first human embassy in Alinor. Of course, we could not regain control of the Heartlands for a long time, but we have never made this fact open to all the citizens. If we agree to allow people to open their Residency, this will be tantamount to recognizing defeat in a centuries-old conflict, but it will open up new opportunities for us on the continent. However, public refusal can increase the prestige of our government among the aristocracy."
 es_31_scenario.10.a: "Let's welcome our new friends!"

 FOUR_SCORE_WAR: "Four Score War"
 FOUR_SCORE_WAR_DESC: "The confrontation between Cyrodiil and Morrowind is growing. Having lost other rivals in the political arena, these two forces began to draw troops to the borders among the mountains of Nibenai and Eastern Skyrim. One spark will be enough for the devastating Flames of War to burst from Oblivion and descend on nothing unsuspecting Tamriel. On the other side of the continent, among the tropical Summerset Islands, it is also restlessly - more and more ships of once defeated Sloads appear on the horizon. Are they getting ready to release another plague?"
 
 es_32_scenario.1.t: "Four Score War"
 es_32_scenario.1.d: "Over the years, our relationship with Morrowind has been fairly neutral. Recently, however, tensions have been growing between our governments, caused by the expansion of both our empire and the growing influence of the Tribunal. Armed clashes are increasingly occurring at the border, and trade is waning year after year. The Dunmer claims to our Argonian possessions also cause concern. Perhaps we should fundamentally revise the policy towards such neighbours."
 es_32_scenario.1.a: "Maybe a small war will help these elves to understand our position?"

 es_32_scenario.2.d: "News comes to us that one of the terrible dragons themselves, who for centuries terrorized our peasants, was killed today in the Jerall Mountains. These tidings were met with shouting in villages throughout our country. We hope that the slayer of this monster will also visit our lands so that we honour him."

 es_32_scenario.3.t: "Ties of our Consort"
 es_32_scenario.3.d: "Rumor has it that our ruling consort may have connections with intelligence from hostile countries. Previously, we tried to hide these facts or not pay attention to them. However, the latest rules of our agents indicate that there is a leak of information, moreover, from the very top of the government. If we do not take any action, we will put the security of both our country and our ruler at risk. What should we do?"
 es_32_scenario.3.a: "Start an investigation."
 es_32_scenario.3.b: "When did we start to believe rumors?"
 
 es_32_scenario.4.t: "Departure of Almalexia"
 es_32_scenario.4.d: "Almalexia, one of our living goddesses, decided to go on a long journey in search of the mysterious Arteum. No one's persuasion — neither the other members of the Tribunal nor the council of priests — could dissuade her from travelling. Therefore, the only thing left for us is to pray - for ourselves, Almalexia and the future of our people."
 es_32_scenario.4.a: "Will we have a future without her?"
 
 es_32_scenario.5.t: "War of the Uvichil"
 es_32_scenario.5.d: "Over the years, we tried to return the Summerset Islands to the bosom of the Coral Kingdom, but no avail. Nothing could help us in the implementation of our plans - neither the plague, nor the mercenaries, nor the devastating raids. But our aristocracy does not intend to give up. Ships are now gathering for a new invasion of High Elf lands. Should we support this fair cause?"
 es_32_scenario.5.a: "Once we will return Summerset!"

 es_32_scenario.6.t: "Assassins of Morag Tong"
 es_32_scenario.6.d: "The unthinkable happened tonight in the Palace. A group of killers, presumably belonging to the Morrowind organization Morag Tong, attacked our ruler and murdered him in their chambers, after killing all his guards. The crime was committed insolently and in cold blood, so we do not doubt that they had their people among the servants. And this means that such a murder can be repeated, with any nobleman. No one is safe!"
 es_32_scenario.6.a: "We must stop them!"
 
 es_32_scenario.7.t: "Destruction of Mournhold"
 es_32_scenario.7.d: "Merunes Dagon, Lord of Destruction, attacked Mornhold with an army of his fanatical Daedra and loyal servants, who were hiding in the mountains. The garrison had no chance to withstand such an armada, but they tried to restrain the hordes of enemies with all their might. Now a major part of the city is on fire. Creatures from Oblivion scour the streets, killing those lucky ones who managed to survive the assault. At this time, the Daedra plunder the palaces in the central part of the city, destroying the priceless artefacts of the past."
 es_32_scenario.7.a: "We will return the city to ourselves!"
 
 es_32_scenario.8.t: "Slow Work on Alduin's Wall"
 es_32_scenario.8.d: "Unfortunately, following the reports on the construction of the Alduin Wall, it is obvious that the work will not be completed on time. There are many reasons for this, which are detailed in additional reports. But they got lost somewhere on the way to us."
 es_32_scenario.8.a: "That's suspicious..."
 
 es_32_scenario.9.t: "Audit of Work on Alduin's Wall"
 es_32_scenario.9.d: "The deadlines for the completion of the Alduin Wall are once again at stake. And again, we cannot get all the information about what is happening on the construction site itself. Therefore, some advisers propose sending auditors from the Dragon Guard to check on those unpleasant rumours that come here instead of papers."
 es_32_scenario.9.a: "Send Grandmaster of the Dragon Guard to Sky Haven Temple."
 es_32_scenario.9.b: "We will wait for more."
 
 es_32_scenario.10.t: "Work on Alduin's Wall is finished"
 es_32_scenario.10.d: "The creation of the Alduin Wall is officially over. This large Akavir bas-relief will now forever become the decoration of the Sky Haven Temple. The Wall depicts some key events from Tamriel's history, such as the Dragon War, the Great Schism and Middle Dawn, the fall of the Tribunal and the eruption of the Red Mountain, the Oblivion Crisis, the civil war in Skyrim and the return of Alduin, the World Eater."
 es_32_scenario.10.a: "Finally!"
 
 AKAVIRI_POTENTATE: "Akaviri Potentate"
 AKAVIRI_POTENTATE_DESC: "In the centre of Tamriel, the redistribution of power begins again, ready to turn into a new civil war. Replaced by the Reman dynasty, which at the end of their reign plunged the country into chaos, a new force came straight from distant Akavir. Will the new government, led by Potentate, overcome the cultural contradictions, territorial disputes of feudal lords and threats from many enemies? Or will it be just another round in the agony of the Second Empire? It seems that only the Gods know the answers to these questions."
 
 es_33_scenario.1.t: "Akaviri Potentate"
 es_33_scenario.1.d: "The recent successful attempt on the life of our ruler by the assassins of Morag Tong shows the weakness of the current regime, in which neither the nobles nor the peasants want to preserve the current way of life. The people are tired of endless wars, and the nobles from successive rulers. And in this difficult time for our country, only one person cares about the prosperity of its people - an adviser Versidue Shaie. It was only thanks to his efforts that people could again feel the joys of a peaceful life in wartime. Therefore, when units of Versidue Shaie took control of the Imperial city to guarantee the stability of the Empire, crowds of people took to the streets to greet their saviour."
 es_33_scenario.1.a: "Long live, Versidue Shaie!"
 es_33_scenario.1.b: "We will never be ruled by an Akaviri Lizard!"

 es_33_scenario.2.t: "Dawn of Second Era"
 es_33_scenario.2.d: "The world is changing rapidly. Old empires collapse like sand castles washed away by the waves of modern times, and new nations break the slave chains and begin to search for their path. We were lucky to survive many storms in the past, but many more obstacles await us on our way to the stars."
 es_33_scenario.2.a: "May the Gods guide us!"
 
 es_33_scenario.3.t: "Order of Black Worm"
 es_33_scenario.3.d: "Our people have always felt a craving for forbidden knowledge. Justified by the desire to make the world a better place, to clear it of evil in the name of the light, with each step they more and more approach the line beyond which absolute darkness lurks. But people still cross it, in search of power, money or immortality. Necromancy has always made it possible to find all of the above. And now one of the largest orders, headed by a fugitive from a mythical island, settled in Necrom, accepting the invitation of the local aristocracy."
 es_33_scenario.3.a: "And what services can they provide us?"
 es_33_scenario.3.b: "In our country, there is no place both for necromancers and their patrons!"
 
 es_33_scenario.4.t: "Mannimarco and Molag Bal"
 es_33_scenario.4.d: "The Order of the Black Worm was involved in a conspiracy with Molag Bal, and we were just a pawn in a ruthless game. But when the necromancers gained unprecedented power, they decided to break the contract and enter into direct conflict with the Daedric Prince to maintain their position in the mortal world. Since now all the cards are open, both warring parties want to lure us to themselves. Mannimarco suggests reforming the Order and extending our power throughout Tamriel if we agree to support it in the final battle with Molag Bal. And the Daedric Prince promises us his protection and help if we give him all the members of the Order of the Black Worm voluntarily."
 es_33_scenario.4.a: "Side with Mannimarco."
 es_33_scenario.4.b: "Side with Molag Bal."
 
 es_33_scenario.5.t: "Fall of Order of Black Worm"
 es_33_scenario.5.d: "The Necromancer stronghold fell today at dawn under the onslaught of our enemies. Neither the high walls, nor the fanaticism of the defenders, nor the crowds of the undead could prevent this. Mannimarco, leader of the Order of the Black Worm, was found dead on the sacrificial altar. It seems that in the last minutes he would be betrayed by his most devoted followers. This event is undoubtedly the end of the most powerful forbidden school that has ever existed ... but maybe one day, anyone will decide to revive it?"
 es_33_scenario.5.a: "Disaster!"
 
 es_33_scenario.6.t: "Guild of Mages"
 es_33_scenario.6.d: "Necromancers and other dark sorcerers are gaining strength every day. Soon they can become a threat not only for Tamriel but for the whole of Nirn. Therefore, one of the greatest magicians of our time - Vanus Galerion - asks us for permission to establish the Mages Guild, here in the Imperial City, for an organized fight against forbidden schools. Of course, this will require serious financial support from our side. But on the other hand, magicians can help us both in science and military affairs, especially when their leader is indebted to us."
 es_33_scenario.6.a: "This is an investment in our future."
 es_33_scenario.6.b: "If this magician so wants to fight evil - give him an army."
 
 es_33_scenario.7.t: "Divided Nation"
 es_33_scenario.7.d: "Many of our once faithful vassals cease to pay taxes and send soldiers, referring to the fact that they did not swear allegiance to the Akavir Usurper. Of course, the real reason is much more prosaic - they want to get the power, money and land that we once took from them. We should have enough reserves for several months ... but then we will have to look for other ways to replenish the armies and treasury."
 es_33_scenario.7.a: "Disaster"
 
 es_33_scenario.8.t: "Fort is Raided"
 es_33_scenario.8.d: "One of our forts in northern Skyrim was attacked by an unknown enemy unit. The attack was unexpected and desperate, so despite all the heroes of the defenders, the fort was captured in a few hours, and its treasury was plundered. Unfortunately, the damage to the buildings is so severe that we cannot continue to use this defensive structure."
 es_33_scenario.8.a: "Find those bandits as soon as possible!"
 
 es_33_scenario.9.t: "Council of Bardmont"
 es_33_scenario.9.d: "Unfortunately, as the situation inside the country continues to deteriorate rapidly, the members of the Imperial Council decided to gather in the city of Bardmont to discuss a plan to overcome the crisis. Most of the gathered aristocrats say that we are obliged to declare martial law. However, a small group of the oldest members of the Council indicate that in the event of such an act the authority of the government will be completely undermined. The meeting has been going on for several days without a break. And we need to make a choice."

 es_33_scenario.20.d: "The time has come to unite the disparate Elsweyr tribes into one state. Of course, this will be a long and difficult job. It will be necessary to overcome a huge number of contradictions, to convince rulers of various tribes of the need for federalization, and finally to explain to each Khajiit that in these difficult times for all of Tamriel, we need to be together. The representatives of the two largest tribes - Anequina and Pelletine - have already agreed to begin the process of unification by marriage. Now we can only decide how to negotiate with other Elsweyr states."

 es_33_scenario.21.b: "Deny the offer."
 
 es_33_scenario.22.t: "Guilds Act"
 es_33_scenario.22.d: "Guilds always influence our politics. They give us money, soldiers, share knowledge with us, and allow us to carry out various illegal actions in other states. Each time our power weakens, on the contrary, their strength grows upward. Current events taking place in our country are no exception. Representatives of various guilds gathered in the White-Gold Tower to present us with a new agreement guaranteeing their loyalty, in return for the provision of new privileges and consolidation of existing ones."

Soon, these once rich lands, impoverished due to endless wars and strife, will witness a new battle for the right to be the ruler of Tamriel between representatives of the three Alliances that are about to emerge in different parts of the Continent. Will the Imperials survive this massacre or the agony of the last stronghold of the Empire will end here and now?"

 es_34_scenario.100.d: "At a time when former empires collapsed into the flames of Chaos and Despair, there will always be those who wish to take their place, whatever the price. Today on the political map of Tamriel three Alliances have arisen, which are united by fear of the future, a thirst for power in the present, and shameful days in the past. Soon they will fight each other in yet another senseless and bloody war, in which there can only be one winner - death."

 es_34_scenario.1.d: "Another of our rulers fell victim to the murderer’s blade, which is not surprising, because he had many enemies both inside the country and abroad, and in the last months of his life he lost the confidence of even his advisers. Now aristocrats from all over the country are gathering in White-Gold Tower to discuss the eternal question - who will rule and who will obey? However, now more and more calls are being made to dissolve the current government and create a new governing body that will represent the interests of all nobles. Since common people are also tired of the constant change of rulers, which did not stop even under the new regime, the aristocracy has every chance of winning. Therefore, if we want to maintain the current state of things, we need to act extremely quickly."

 es_34_scenario.2.d: "When the last illusion of centralized power disappears in the former expanses of the Empire, every city, landowner, or even a ruined aristocrat wants to gain power, wealth or glory until centralized power regains order. And this is happening throughout our territory. Cities refuse to pay taxes, landowners delay the supply of food and supplies, and the nobles do not want to serve in our troops. In other words, the crisis that once elevated us to the throne now throws us off of it. But we are not the defenceless Reman Empire, which has lost all its power - we are still able to fight for our place under the sun."

However, now that our overlord is weak and bogged down in internecine wars, we have the opportunity to regain our independence. Of course, this plan is adventurous, and many who decide to participate in it will die on the battlefield. But you cannot make merchants out of orcs."

And now, when the orcs recovered from their crushing defeat, they are preparing for a new confrontation with us. We need to send additional forces to this region to maintain order. But if we do not have free reserves, then it is better to leave Orsinium than to wallow in a protracted guerrilla war."

Presumably, the cause of the conflict was religious controversy. Unfortunately, the city guards could not stop the massacre in the city centre, since they only had the strength to keep the government block and help the wounded citizens. The rest of the city became a battlefield, in the heat of which houses, shops, and warehouses were destroyed. Only the regular army could put an end to the confrontation, but by the time she approached Kvatch, the whole city was already engulfed in flames."

 es_34_scenario.9.d: "In the territories under our control of Valenwood, the liberation movement is gaining strength against our presence in the region. The actions of the rebels are still rather chaotic, which indicates the absence of a central command or its inability to coordinate the actions of their units. However, since most of the attacks fall on our convoys and caravans, we are forced to increase the number of guards, as well as build additional mounts along the roads."

We have already begun to prepare additional places in hospitals and check people for symptoms at the borders, but it is unlikely that we will be able to restrain the disease for a long time. At the same time, our best doctors began to develop a medicine based on the fact that the Argonians - one of the minor swamp races - are almost completely immune to the disease."
 es_34_scenario.14.a: "May the Gods help us all!"
 
 es_34_scenario.17.t: "Knahaten Flu in Anvil"
 es_34_scenario.17.d: "The disease got to the pearl of Colovia. Presumably, it was brought into the city by one of the many ships arriving in the city every day. We have already quarantined and closed the port... but it seems it's already too late."
 es_34_scenario.17.a: "Disaster!"
 
 es_34_scenario.18.t: "Knahaten Flu in Alinor"
 es_34_scenario.18.d: "The disease got to the pearl of Summerset Islands. Presumably, it was brought into the city by one of the many ships arriving in the city every day. We have already quarantined and closed the port... but it seems it's already too late."
 
 es_34_scenario.19.t: "Day of Shame"
 es_34_scenario.19.d: "A ship with refugees from Kothringia wishes to enter our port. They run out of supplies and drinking water. Of course, we can help them, but there is a problem - the ship is most likely infected with the Knahaten flu, and if we let the ship into the port, then all Hammerfell will be in danger. However, if we refuse to help refugees, we will doom them to death in the open sea. From a moral point of view, this problem is insoluble ... but we will have to make a choice."
 es_34_scenario.19.a: "It is rather be dishonoured than dead."
 es_34_scenario.19.b: "We must help everyone in need."
 
 es_34_scenario.20.t: "New Consort"
 es_34_scenario.20.d: "Dynastic marriages exist not only for the sake of the appearance of heirs for the throne, but also to improve relations with neighbours. That is why the choice of a consort for our country must be approached wisely. We have already sent out proposals from our dynastic alliance to all ends of Tamriel. Unfortunately, we can only choose one consort. Therefore, we hope that those whom our choice bypasses will not start a war against us."
 es_34_scenario.20.a: "Choose Redguard consort."
 es_34_scenario.20.b: "Choose Nordic consort."
 es_34_scenario.20.c: "Choose Altmer consort."
 es_34_scenario.20.e: "Choose Breton consort."
 
 es_34_scenario.21.t: "Conquest of Tamriel"
 es_34_scenario.21.d: "Legends of a distant and rich continent did not lie to us. Indeed, in the northwest of us lie colossal lands, which, as it turned out, are accessible for conquest by the example of Tsaesci. Of course, at the start, we will need to gain a foothold in a territory with a cold climate that is familiar to us - and our merchants were even able to exchange maps of such places from Po Tun merchants. We only need to gather an army and appoint a commander for it. And we already have a candidate for this position."
 es_34_scenario.21.a: "Gather ships! We set off at sunrise."
 es_34_scenario.21.b: "A military campaign does not always generate income, unlike trade missions."
 es_34_scenario.21.c: "Firstly we must solve our problems at homelands."
 
 es_34_scenario.22.t: "Collapse of Imperial Provinces"
 es_34_scenario.22.d: "Problems within our country have begun to affect the state of affairs in our Imperial Provinces. More and more nobles, merchants and ordinary townspeople oppose our presence in their native regions. Our administration is still coping with displeasure, but even it recognizes that the situation is becoming critical. If we do not want to start a civil war, then we need to consider the option of granting independence to our provinces. Otherwise, we must begin the mobilization of our armed forces."
 es_34_scenario.22.a: "We will not survive another civil war."
 es_34_scenario.22.b: "If they are ready to die for freedom, then we give them such a chance!"

 THE_PLANEMELD: "The Planemeld"
 THE_PLANEMELD_DESC: "Molag Bal, the Daedric Prince of Domination and Enslavement, will soon make another attempt to subjugate Tamriel. He has a huge Daedric army on his side, and all the hope of Nirn lies on the shoulders of disparate states still fighting for the Ruby Throne in the Imperial City. Can Molag Bal's invasion force the warring parties to end the war? Or will everyone fight for themselves? Will Tamriel fall into the hands of a cruel ruler, Daedra, or man?"
 
 es_35_scenario.1.t: "Emperor Leovic Reachmen"
 es_35_scenario.1.d: "A severe economic crisis continues in our republic, caused by the fall of the Akaviri Protectorate and the events of the period of the Interregnum. Unfortunately, we cannot agree on ways to overcome our difficulties, since each delegate has his view of the situation, which fundamentally diverges from the representations of other members. Therefore, it is not surprising that the sudden appearance in the Imperial City of one of the leaders of the Richmen named Leovic, who scattered gold right and left and promised to restore order in the country, caused the most heated discussions in the Government. According to our data, he has already bribed most of the garrison, half of our generals, and the chief treasurer. Thus, it will be very difficult to stop such a purposeful person."
 es_35_scenario.1.a: "Why should we stop him if he already bought us all?"
 es_35_scenario.1.b: "Another threat to our Republic... why I am not surprised?"
 
 es_35_scenario.2.t: "Rebellion of Varen Aquilarios"
 es_35_scenario.2.d: "The country is growing discontent caused by the reign of Emperor Leovic. As it turned out, spraying gold is easier than managing a crumbling country. Rebellions flare up across the country, and even in the Imperial City itself, plotters make plans to overthrow the Emperor. The greatest success in creating the rebel army was achieved by Varen Aquilarios. However, many say that he sold his Soul to Molag Bal for this, since Daedra worship is legalized in the regions controlled by Varen. This could be the biggest threat to our country's unity since the Akavir invasion."
 es_35_scenario.2.a: "Varen Aquilarios may become our saviour!"
 es_35_scenario.2.b: "We will never worship the Daedra again!"
 
 es_35_scenario.3.t: "Amulet of Kings is Lost"
 es_35_scenario.3.d: "In the heat of uprisings, coups and wars, shaking Cyrodiil over the past years, the Amulet of Kings disappeared from the Imperial Treasury. According to the investigation, he was last seen on Leovic Reachmen when his dead body was taken out of the Throne Hall. The further trail of the Amulet is lost. Perhaps the servants of the temple of the Eight Divines hid it so that Amulet would not go to the hands of Daedric cultists. Nevertheless, the loss of such a powerful artefact threatens the safety of all Nirn."
 es_35_scenario.3.a: "We should find it as soon as possible!"
 
 es_35_scenario.5.t: "The Planemeld"
 es_35_scenario.5.d: "After two years of searching, the Five Companions have finally recovered the Amulet of Kings from Sancre Tor. It was returned to his rightful owner Varen Aquilarios who wanted to use it to become Dragonborn. However, Mannimarco, one of the Five Companions, betrays the Emperor, corrupting the ritual and breaking the covenant with Akatosh that sealed Nirn from Oblivion. As the result, a massive explosion of arcane energy, the Soulburst, erupted in the Imperial City, causing Varen to vanish. Mystical aftershocks swept across Nirn, causing mages to die or go mad. The Daedra appeared in greater numbers than ever before and the constellation of the Serpent, signifying chaos, appeared so large that it dominated the night sky. The Planemeld has begone."
 es_35_scenario.5.a: "Disaster!"
 
 es_35_scenario.7.t: "Five Companions"
 es_35_scenario.7.d: "Varen Aquilarios, new Emperor of Cyrodiil, seeks to legitimize his claim to the Ruby Throne and forms the Five Companions to find the long-lost Amulet of Kings in the hopes that Varen could make himself Dragonborn. The Five Companions consisted of Lyris Titanborn, Mannimarco, Sai Sahan, Varen Aquilarios, and Abnur Tharn. Will a group of five heroes be able to help the tyrant in the implementation of his plans, or will one of them decide to use the power of the Amulet for himself?"
 es_35_scenario.7.a: "Interesting..."
 
 es_35_scenario.8.t: "The Planemeld is Over"
 es_35_scenario.8.d: "Molag Bal is defeated by the Vestige in the bloody and cruel battle. Even though it was Molag Bal who survived, he no longer had the strength or ability to continue the invasion of Nirn. The Planemeld ends."

 es_35_scenario.10.t: "Conquest of Cyrodiil"
 es_35_scenario.10.d: "The empire is dead and will never rise again. Cyrodiil is too long in the heat of chaos and debacle. Our time has come to enter the Heart of Tamriel as winners and restore order in the region. The time is coming for a new Empire - our empire!"

 es_35_scenario.11.d: "Today, in several regions of the country, legions of Oblivion spawns sprang up from nowhere and began to sow destruction and death throughout the district. They spared no one, neither women, nor children, nor centuries-old buildings that have long been considered as Daedric Temples. Local forces were able to deal with most of the interventionists, however, according to rumours, the largest Dremoran army is heading to our capital. It must be stopped!"

 es_35_scenario.12.t: "Sack of $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 es_35_scenario.12.d: "The huge Daedra army appeared right in the centre of our capital tonight. Although all the forces of our garrison were thrown to stop the advance of the enemy deep into government quarters, they only managed to restrain the hordes of Daedra for a while. Now the whole city is in flames, and uninvited guests disappeared as suddenly as they appeared."

 es_35_scenario.14.d: "Molag Ball, Daedric Prince of Domination and Enslavement, seeing our plight, offers a deal. It will help us restore stability in the country. However, in return, he demands to acknowledge his power over us and sacrifice the most valuable that we have."

 es_35_scenario.15.d: "How much time do we still suffer from the actions of Molag Bal? How many more lives should our soldiers give to save the country from the hordes of Daedra? The time has come for us to use the portals that our enemy so kindly left open and transfer the war to its territory!"

 es_35_scenario.16.t: "Captain Rana"
 es_35_scenario.16.d: "The waters north of Tamriel are extremely important to us and our allies. Control over them ensures uninterrupted trade and the ability to quickly transfer supplies and even entire armies to High Rock, Skyrim and Vvardenfell. Therefore, to ensure the safety of our fleet and to monitor other ships in the region, our allies are asking for permission to build a base on a separate remote island. Since the base is built largely by Morrowind’s investments, the Dunmer want the base to be controlled by the Dark Elf. Many of our soldiers, who make up most of the island’s garrison, may not like this."
 es_35_scenario.16.a: "New fortifications cost discontent among the military."
 es_35_scenario.16.b: "None of our bases will be controlled by Elves!"

 es_35_scenario.17.d: "Mortuum Vivicus was an artefact located in the ruins of Ayleid city of Abagarlas. For centuries it was an important sanctuary for all followers of Daedra. However, the Fighters Guild, in their war with servants of Molag Bal managed to destroy it. his battle is one step closer to the defeat of Molag Bal in his invasion of Tamriel. Will the war be over soon?"

 es_35_scenario.18.d: "The Winterborn Clan consists of a group of Reachmen who lived in High Rock, west of the Reach for many years until they were driven out by the Orcs. Now, they are gathering strength to regain the lands that belonged to their ancestors. We can help them fulfil their goals to claim their lands since it is obvious that the small mercenary army of the Winterborn Clan will not be able to withstand the horde of orcs. Or we can let them start the war in Orsinium themselves and take advantage of the chaos that has arisen to advance their interests in the region. The choice is ours."
 es_35_scenario.18.a: "We must take them into our army!"

 es_35_scenario.20.d: "Last night, during a secret meeting with the leaders of the Orc tribes, our ruler was killed. It is difficult to say what caused the conflict. Since the palace guards did not intervene in the events taking place behind closed doors, we assume that they were bribed. The Leaders guilty of the murder justify themselves by defending themselves, because $MONARCH$ attacked them first, accusing them of treason. Nevertheless, while the trial is in progress, we must choose a new ruler or convene a regency council."
