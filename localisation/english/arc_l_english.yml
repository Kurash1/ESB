 auriels_bow_desc: "Auriels Bow appears as a modest Elven Longbow, but it is one of the mightiest ever to exist in Tamriels history. Allegedly created and used, like its sister Auriels Shield, by the great Elvish demi-god, the Bow can turn any arrow into a missile of death and destruction. Without Auriels power behind it, however, the bow uses its own store of energy for its power. Once exhausted of this energy, the bow will vanish and reappear whereever chance puts it. Its most recent appearances have been the subject of gossip for hundreds of years."
 auriels_shield_desc: "Auriels Shield, an Ebony shield said to have once belonged to the quasi-mythical Elvish deity Auriel, can make its wielder nigh invulnerable. In its resistance to fire and magick, Auriels Shield is unsurpassed. To defend its wielder from any attacks it cannot absorb, the Shield lends him or her health. Like many artifacts of Tamriel, the Shield has life and personality of its own, and does not feel bound to its user. A popular fable tells the tale of it abandoning one wielder in her greatest hour of need, but this is perhaps, apocryphal."
 azuras_star_desc: "Few mortals have the stomach to trade in souls. The Dark Brotherhood does it, as do certain groups within the Mages Guild. For these cruel folk, Azuras Star has a particular fascination. The Star acts as a reusable soul gem. The soul of any creature killed by the bearer of the Star is trapped within it. If the Star already carries a soul, nothing happens. Using Azuras Star empties it, freeing the trapped soul to make its journey to Oblivion. Azuras Star can be used to make magical items over and over and over."
 ebony_blade_desc: "The Ebony Blade, sometimes called the Vampire or the Leech, resembles an ebony katana, but its power is very dark indeed. Every time the Ebony Blade strikes an opponent, part of the damage inflicted flows into the wielder as raw power. The Blade itself may not be any more evil than those who have used it, but at some point in its long existence, a charm was cast on it so it would not remain with one bladesman. The wizard who cast this charm sought to save the souls of any too infatuated by the Blade, and perhaps he was right..."
 ebonys_mail_desc: "I am alive because that one is dead. I exist because I have the will to do so. And I shall remain as long as there are signs of my handwork, such as the blood dripping from this blade. Accepting my gift, she nodded and said: Indeed."
 hircines_ring_desc: "The curse of lycanthropy has its advantages. The incredible strength, speed, ferocity of a werebeast makes it a fearsome opponent. There are, of course, disadvantages. The bearer of the Hircine Ring can choose when to be a lycanthrope and when not. Essentially this gives him all the advantages with few of the negatives."
 chrysamere_desc: "Chrysamere, the Paladins Blade and Sword of Heroes, is an ancient claymore with offensive capabilities only surpassed by its defenses. It lends the wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects any deletory spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not to favor one champion."
 king_orgnums_coffer1_desc: "King Orghums Coffer is a small-sized chest, ordinary in appearance. It is remarkably light, almost weightless, which offers a clue to its true magic. Once a day, the Coffer will create gold from naught. When King Orghum himself possessed the Coffer, the supply within was limitless. Those who have found it since report that the Coffer eventually disappears after having dispersed enough gold to shame even the wealthiest of merchants. Where and why it vanishes is still a mystery."
 king_orgnums_coffer2_desc: "King Orghums Coffer is a small-sized chest, ordinary in appearance. It is remarkably light, almost weightless, which offers a clue to its true magic. Once a day, the Coffer will create gold from naught. When King Orghum himself possessed the Coffer, the supply within was limitless. Those who have found it since report that the Coffer eventually disappears after having dispersed enough gold to shame even the wealthiest of merchants. Where and why it vanishes is still a mystery."
 king_orgnums_coffer3_desc: "King Orghums Coffer is a small-sized chest, ordinary in appearance. It is remarkably light, almost weightless, which offers a clue to its true magic. Once a day, the Coffer will create gold from naught. When King Orghum himself possessed the Coffer, the supply within was limitless. Those who have found it since report that the Coffer eventually disappears after having dispersed enough gold to shame even the wealthiest of merchants. Where and why it vanishes is still a mystery."
 king_orgnums_coffer4_desc: "King Orghums Coffer is a small-sized chest, ordinary in appearance. It is remarkably light, almost weightless, which offers a clue to its true magic. Once a day, the Coffer will create gold from naught. When King Orghum himself possessed the Coffer, the supply within was limitless. Those who have found it since report that the Coffer eventually disappears after having dispersed enough gold to shame even the wealthiest of merchants. Where and why it vanishes is still a mystery."
 lords_mail_desc: "It is an ancient plated adamantium, mithril, or ebony cuirass of unsurpassable quality, considered to be heavy armor. It grants the wearer the power to absorb or regenerate health, resist the effects of spells, and resist or even cure poison. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer unworthy, the Lords Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one. The Mail was originally owned during the Merethic Era by the bull Morihaus, a demigod and early cultural hero of the Cyro-Nordics who was closely associated with Kynareth and the Lord. The cuirass was rumored to have later been taken from Morihaus by Kynareth herself due to his arrogance. The cuirass is sacred to the Imperial Legion and the Imperial Cult, and is accepted as uniform in the Legion. Indeed, the armor has been known to bear the red dragon sigil of the Third Empire on its breastplate."
 mace_of_molag_bal_desc: "Also known as the Vampires Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its victims of spell points and gives them to the bearer. If the victim has no spell points, he is drained of strength, which is also transferred to the wielder. Using the Mace of Molag Bal can actually give its bearer more spell points or more strength than he would have fully rested. However, these bonus points are temporary. Molag Bal has been quite free with his artifact. There are many legends about the mace. It seems to be a favorite for vanquishing mad wizards."
 masque_of_clavicus_vile_desc: "Ever the vain one, Clavicus Vile made a masque suited to his own personality. The bearer of the masque is more likely to get a positive response from the people of Tamriel. The higher his personality, the larger the bonus. The best known story of the masque tells the tale of Avalea, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the masque in return. Though the masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well connected baron, Clavicus reclaimed his masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the barons household. Twenty-one years and one day later, Avaleas daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the baron."
 mehrunes_razor_desc: "The Dark Brotherhood has covetted this ebony dagger for generations. This mythical artifact is capable of slaying any creature instantly. Victims of the Razor must save vs. magic or be slain. History does not record any bearers of Mehrunes Razor. However, eighty years ago the Dark Brotherhood was decimated by a vicious internal power struggle. It is suspected that the razor was involved."
 necromancers_amulet_desc: "The legendary Necromancers Amulet, the last surviving relic of the mad sorcerer Mannimarco, grants any spellcaster who wears it the ability to absorb magical energy and regenerate from injury. The Amulet is mystically fortified to give the person wearing it an armor rating equivalent to plate armor, without the weight and restriction of movement. This makes the artifact popular amongst thieves and mages alike. It is the one flaw of the Amulet that it is unstable in this world - forever doomed to fade in and out of existence, reappearing at locations distant from that of its disappearance."
 ring_of_khajiit_desc: "The Ring of the Khajiiti is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older than Rajhin, the thief who made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used the Rings powers to make himself as invisible, silent, and quick as a breath of wind. Using the Ring he became the most successful burglar in Elsweyrs history. Rajhins eventual fate is a mystery, but according to legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared, leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies..."
 ring_of_namira_desc: "Namira is aligned with the darker side of nature, as is her ring. While the ring is being worn, any damage the bearer takes is suffered by the attacker as well. Spells and missile attacks are ignored. How much damage the attacker suffers depends upon his nature. Animals and Spriggans take no damage, being creatures of natures. Daedric beings only take half the damage they do, being supernatural creatures. Humanoids and monsters take full damage. Undead take twice the damage they dole out, because they are wholly unnatural creatures."
 ring_of_phynaster_desc: "The Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a person who needed good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring, Phynaster lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from person to person. The ring improves its wearers overall resistance to damage and grants total immunity to poison, spells, and electricity. Still, Phynaster was cunning and said to have cursed the Ring. It eventually disappears from its holders possessions and returns to another resting place, uncontent to stay anywhere but with Phynaster himself."
 skeleton_key_desc: "The power of the Skeleton Key is very simple, indeed. With it, any non-magically locked door or chest is instantly accessible to even the clumsiest of lockpickers. A particularly skillful lockpicker may even open some magically barred doors with the Key. The two limitations placed on the Key by wizards who sought to protect their storehouses were that the Key could only be used once a day and it would never be the property of one thief for too long. Some of those who have possessed the Key have made themselves rich before it disappeared, others have broken into places they never should have entered ..."
 skull_of_corruption_desc: "Using the Skull of Corruption on an opponent creates a duplicate of the victim. However, this duplicate will attack the original, not the wielder of the Skull. There is a story about the Thieves Guild Master and the skull that is probably fiction, but highly amusing. The Master used the skull on her enemy, creating a clone of him to fight. After defeating the original, the clever duplicate snatched the Skull from the Master and used it on her. Although the cloned enemy could not directly attack the Master, it could use the Skull to create a duplicate Master. The two clones jointly ruled the Thieves Guild for years."
 spell_breaker_desc: "Spell Breaker, superficially a Dwarven tower shield, is one of the most prized ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historic importance dating from the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost completely from any spellcaster, either by dispelling magicks or silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that the Spell Breaker still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of any one else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any time is power enough."
 staff_of_magnus_desc: "The Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, the Arch-Mage Magnus. When used, it regenerates both a mages health and mystical energy at remarkable rates. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he or she becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical balance it is sworn to protect."
 volendrung_desc: "The Hammer of Might, Volendrung is said to have been created by the Dwarves of the now abandoned clan of Rourken, hundreds of years before they disappeared from the world of Tamriel. It has the ability to grant health to its wielder, but it is best known for the paralyzing and strength leeching effects it has when cast at an enemy. Like the Dwarves who created it, Volendrung is prone to disappearing suddenly, resurfacing sometimes in days, sometimes in eons."
 wabbajack_desc: "Madness and chaos are the trademarks of Sheogorath. The Wabbajack embodies these same traits. Using the artifact on a creature will transform it into something else. The creature can become any one of the following monsters: rat, imp, spriggan, giant bat, grizzly bear, spider, nymph, harpy, skeletal warrior, giant, zombie, giant scorpion, iron atronach, flesh atronach, ice atronach, fire atronach, lich. The problem is the bearer has no way of controlling the transformation. He could change a giant bat into a lich, or a fire atronach into a rat."
 warlocks_ring_desc: "The Warlocks Ring of the Arch-Mage Syrabane is one of the most popular relics of myth and fable. In Tamriels ancient history, Syrabane saved all of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it has helped adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its ability to reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her speed and health, though it may have additional powers. No adventurer can wear the Warlocks Ring for long, for it is said the Ring is Syrabanes alone to command."
 amulet_of_heartfire_desc: "The Amulet of Heartfire is an enchanted necklace worn by Dagoth Odros in Citadel Odrosal, whom you'll have to kill during the assault on the Citadels of the Sixth House."
 amulet_of_heartheal_desc: "The Amulet of Heartheal is a powerful Sixth House artifact worn by Dagoth Vemyn in Citadel Vemynal, whom you'll have to kill during the assault on the Citadels of the Sixth House."
 amulet_of_heartrime_desc: "The Amulet of Heartrime is worn by Dagoth Endus in Citadel Endusal, whom you'll have to kill during the assault on the Citadels of the Sixth House."
 amulet_of_heartthrum_desc: "The Amulet of Heartthrum is an enchanted amulet worn by Dagoth Tureynul in Citadel Tureynulal, whom you'll have to kill during the assault on the Citadels of the Sixth House."
 amulet_of_usheeja_desc: "The Amulet of Usheeja can be found on a table in the vaults in the lower level of Ghostgate's Tower of Dusk."
 belt_of_heartfire_desc: "Worn by Dagoth Uthol in the ruins of Kogoruhn, whom you may kill during The Path of the Incarnate or the assault on the Citadels of the Sixth House."
 bipolarblade_desc: "Legend has it that a nobleman sank his fortune into creating a blade of supreme power. Two smiths on opposite ends of Tamriel created each half of the blade, unaware of the other, with the hope that no one man, save the owner of the blade, would know its true power. Unfortunately, the smiths were not given enough instruction, and created halves with enchantments that completely negated each other."
 bittercup_desc: "The Bittercup is an artifact located in Ald Redaynia, attributed to the Daedric prince Clavicus Vile, whose sphere is the granting of power and wishes through ritual invocations and pacts."
 blood_ring_desc: "The Blood Ring is a unique ring worn by Dagoth Gilvoth in Citadel Dagoth Ur, whom you are advised to kill during the assault on Dagoth Ur. The ring itself is relatively powerful, offering several effects."
 bloodworm_helm_desc: "The Bloodworm Helm is the necromantic crown of the famed lich Mannimarco, who magically constructed it out of trollbone. Although beautiful to behold, many find the artifact repulsive due to its morbid nature. The helm grants the wearer greater skill at Conjuration, as well as the ability to turn the undead, drain the essence of enemies, and summon a skeletal minion. If the wearer is undead, their attacks are also made more powerful. Mannimarco left the helm behind when he ascended to godhood during the Warp in the West."
 boots_of_the_apostle_desc: "When Talos Stormcrown was a young man in Skyrim, he went into the mountains to learn the secrets of the Greybeards. He learned the secrets of the high peak winds -- the roar of the winter blast, and the warm silk of the summer updrafts. When he descended from the mountains, he came riding the clouds, striding through the air in great boots he claimed were gifts of the Greybeards for his cunning craft and riddling. After Septim yielded his crown, the boots disappeared, and have been lost for many years."
 bow_of_shadows_desc: "Legend has it that the Bow of Shadows was forged by the Daedra Nocturnal. The legendary ranger, Raerlas Ghile, was granted the Bow for a secret mission that failed, and the Bow was lost. Raerlas did not go down without a hearty fight and is said to have, with the aid of the Bow, taken scores of his foes with him. The Bow grants the user the ability of invisibility and increased speed. Many sightings of the Bow of Shadows have been reported, and it is even said that the sinister Dark Elf assassin of the Second Era, Dram, once wielded this bow."
 cleaver_of_saint_felms_desc: "The Cleaver of Saint Felms is a holy axe in the Ash Vampire lair of Tureynulal, on the slopes of the Red Mountain. Uvoo Llaren in the Ghostgate Tribunal Temple will ask you to recover this artifact. If you return when Patriarch of the Temple she will give you this artifact back to keep."
 crosier_of_saint_llothis_desc: "This holy staff is in the crater of Red Mountain in Dagoth Ur's own stronghold. Its enchantments give you a very clear image as to the previous owner's demise. Using this weapon in combat is inadvisable. Uvoo Llaren in the Ghostgate Tribunal Temple will ask you to recover this artifact. See the Crosier of St. Llothis the Pious quest for more information. If you return when Patriarch of the Temple she will give you this artifact back to keep."
 daedric_crescent_desc: "Probably the most rare and even outlawed item of all the great prizes is the Daedric Crescent Blade. The Blade was used by Mehrunes Dagon's Daedric forces in the capture of the Imperial Battlespire. These extremely unique Blades were gathered up and destroyed after the Battlespire was recaptured by the Empire. All but one it seems. Though the Empire believes them all to be destroyed, it is rumored that one still remains in existence, somewhere in Tamriel, though none have ever seen it. The Blade lends it's  wielder the ability to do great damage on an enemy and allows him to paralyze and put heavy wear on his enemy's armor. Quite the prize for any mighty warrior, if it does indeed exist."
 denstagmers_ring_desc: "All that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection from certain elements. Even the name Denstagmer is a mystery."
 dragonbone_cuirass_desc: "This cuirass is one of the greatest artifacts any collector or hero could own. It is constructed of real dragon bone and was enchanted by the first Imperial Battlemage, Zurin Arctus, in the early years of the Third Era. It is a truly exquisite piece of work and many have sought to possess it. The properties of the Cuirass allow the wearer to completely resist fire, and to damage an enemy with a blast of fire. Little is known about the involvement of Zurin Arctus with the enchantment of the Cuirass, but an old tale speaks of a debt that he owed to a traveling warrior. Like the warrior, the Dragonbone Mail never stays put for long."
 eleidons_ward_desc: "Eleidon was a holy knight of legend in Breton history. He was a sought after man for his courage and determination to set all wrongs right. In one story, it is said that he rescued a Baron's daughter from sure death at the hands of an evil warlord. For his reward, the Baron spent all of his riches to have an enchanted shield built for Eleidon. The Shield granted Eleidon the opportunity to heal his wounds."

 the_seizing_of_the_erabenimsun_desc: "The Seizing of the Erabenimsun is an artifact received from Manirai in the Erabenimsun Camp to identify yourself as the Erabenimsun Nerevarine. It has a cast when used telekinesis enchantment."
 fang_of_haynekhtnamet_desc: "Black Marsh was once known to be inhabited with what the Argonians called the Wamasus. Northern men considered them to be intelligent dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, Haynekhtnamet, was slain by the Northern men, though it took 7 days and nights, and a score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy. The fang was carved down into a blade and fashioned into a small dagger. The Dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent. This unique Dagger is seen occasionally by traveling heroes."
 fists_of_randagulf_desc: "Randagulf of Clan Begalin goes down in Tamrielic history as one of the mightiest warriors from Skyrim. He was known for his courage and ferocity in battle and was a factor in many battles. He finally met his fate when King Harald conquered Skyrim. King Harald respected this great hero and took Randagulf's gauntlets for his own. After King Harald died, the gauntlets disappeared. The King claimed that the Fists granted the bearer added strength."
 fork_of_horripilation_desc: "This cursed fork drains 200 points of your Magicka when equipped, and does very little damage at that. But Sheogorath insists that you use it to slay a Giant Bull Netch during his quest. It's well worth the effort, though, as you will be rewarded with the Spear of Bitter Mercy."
 goldbrand_desc: "The sword Goldbrand is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient dragons of the North. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who was sworn to protect the dragons. The Sword lends its wielder the ability to do fire damage on an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero."

Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing his life to the Knahaten Flu. His Helm stood as a monument of his stature for future generations to remember. The Helm was lost eventually, as the Clan split, and is now a treasured artifact for adventurers. The Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw is rumored to improve the wearers agility and endurance."
 helm_of_tohan_desc: "There is a quest attached to the Adamantium Helm of Tohan, a rare and powerful artifact lost in the Sheogorad Region. Word of it has begun to be heard throughout Vvardenfell.

 ice_blade_of_the_monarch_desc: "Probably the most rare and even outlawed item of all the great prizes is the Daedric Crescent Blade. The Blade was used by Mehrunes Dagon's Daedric forces in the capture of the Imperial Battlespire. These extremely unique Blades were gathered up and destroyed after the Battlespire was recaptured by the Empire. All but one it seems.

Quite the prize for any mighty warrior, if it does indeed exist."
 keening_desc: "Keening has dealt you a mortal wound. Keening is a legendary Short Blade crafted by the Dwemer Tonal Architect Lord Kagrenac. Together with Sunder and Wraithguard, these tools are necessary to handle the Heart of Lorkhan. All three artifacts came into the possession of the Almsivi following the Battle of Red Mountain.

The blade is located in the citadel of Odrosal, southeast of Dagoth Ur's Citadel in the center of the island."
 mace_of_aevar_stone_singer_desc: "The Mace of Aevar Stone-Singer is a hard-hitting weapon that is offset by its great weight. It can only be obtained as a reward for The Skaal Test of Loyalty main quest from Tharsten Heart-Fang in the Skaal Village."
 mace_of_slurring_desc: "It was crafted near the end of the second age by Kyanka, a slightly deranged Altmer weaponsmith and enchanter. He had a rather warped sense of humor, and apparently delighted at the thought of reducing opponents to a gibbering mess before crushing them to death. The mace has, admittedly, seen little use."
 madstone_of_the_ahemmusa_desc: "The Madstone of the Ahemmusa is an amulet you will receive from Sinnammu Mirpal of the Ahemmusa Tribe. You will use this enchanted necklace to identify yourself as the Ahemmusa Nerevarine."

 moon_and_star_desc: "Moon-and-Star is a Dwarven ring of the Chimer hero Nerevar. The artifact was forged by one of the smiths of Dwemer Sorcerer-priest Kagrenac and blessed by the Daedric Goddess Azura. The ring lent Nerevar supernatural powers of persuasion and indisputable proof of identity, since any other who tried to wear it would be killed instantly. The Moon-and-Star helped Nerevar unite the warring Chimer clans, and form the First Council which included the Dwemer. Moon-and-Star played a role in the Nerevarine Prophecies, as it allowed the Nerevarine, the reincarnation of Nerevar, to again unite the Great Houses and Ashlander clans, this time in the battle against the forces of Dagoth Ur."
 ring_of_surroundings_desc: "Once upon a time there was a bad magistrate who took gold from criminal organizations to reduce the sentences and fines of criminals. Everybody knew he was doing this, but nobody could prove it. Because even if it could be proved, the bad magistrate had important friends, and proof is not as powerful as important friends. At the same time there was a good officer who enforced the laws because he thought laws made people happy and safe. And it bothered the good officer that enforcing the laws did no good, because the bad magistrate let the criminals go as quick as the officer caught them. For a long time, the good officer sighed, and said, 'What can I do? Because the bad magistrate has important friends, and nothing I can do will touch him. But then, the good officer said, Say. Wait a minute. What about the bad people who are BRIBING the bad magistrate? THEY haven't got important friends. And if they aren't around, then the bad magistrate can't get any more bribes. And even better, the good officer suspected that the bad people who were bribing the bad magistrate were probably criminals themselves. So the good officer decided that it would be good if the bad people who were bribing the bad magistrate should go away. Forever. So that good officer made a little special prayer that there would be a little bloodbath to wash the bad people away. There. Isn't that a nice little story? Maybe not a perfect story. Because it ends with a prayer, and not a bloodbath. But maybe the story isn't over yet."
 ring_of_the_wind_desc: "No facts are known about the Ring of the Wind, but the title and the few rumors lend one to think it grants the wearer added speed."
 robe_of_the_lich_desc: "The Robe of the Lich is the robe worn by the powerful lich Gedna Relvel. It allows the user to gain a temporary boost in magical power at the expense of their life force. Though it has very powerful Fortify Magicka enchantments, this is complicated by the fact that it drains 600 health when used, and both effects last for only one second, too short to actually cast anything. Use of this robe is inadvisable and is better off used as one of two required donated artifacts to complete the Tribunal main quest line."
 sanguine_rose_desc: "The Sanguine Rose is not an artifact most folk would care to have. It summons a lesser daedra to the user. The daedra will attack any other creature in the area except the bearer of the rose. The rose is like any other in that it will wilt. The more of its power that is used, the more wilted it becomes. Eventually all its petals fall off and it loses its powers. Somewhere in Oblivion a new rose blooms and is plucked by Sanguine herself to be given to a new champion."
 saviors_hide_desc: "Another of Hircine's artifacts was the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide. The Cuirass has the special ability to resist magicka. Legend has it that Hircine rewarded his peeled hide to the first and only mortal to have ever escaped his hunting grounds. This unknown mortal had the hide tailored into this magical Cuirass for his future adventures. The Savior's Hide has a tendency to travel from hero to hero as though it has a mind of its own."
 scourge_desc: "The Daedric Scourge is a mighty mace forged from sacred ebony in the Fires of Fickledire. The legendary weapon of Mackkan, it was once a fierce weapon used to send spirits of black back into Oblivion.

Endryn Llethan in the Vivec Temple will ask you to retrieve them for the Tribunal Temple. Once you reach the rank of Patriarch, he will give them back to you as a gift."
 skull_crusher_desc: "The Skull Crusher is an amazingly large, and powerful weapon. The Warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, Dorach Gusal, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, Hilbongard Rolamus. The steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows.

 spear_of_bitter_mercy_desc: "One of the more mysterious artifacts is the Spear of Bitter Mercy. Little to nothing is known about the Spear. There are no recorded histories but many believe it to be of Daedric origin. The only known legend about it is its use by a mighty hero during the fall of the Battlespire. The hero was aided by the Spear in the defeat of Mehrunes Dagon and the recapturing of the Battlespire. Since that time, the Spear of Bitter Mercy has made few appearances within Tamriel."

 staff_of_hasedoki_desc: "Hasedoki was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered the land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of all knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his challenge. It is said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so many feared his power, that he bonded his life-force into his very own staff, where his soul remains to this very day. Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching for this magical staff. Granting its wielder a protection of magicka, it is a sure prize for any magic user."

Trueflame was shattered during the Battle of Red Mountain circa 1E 700, and the pieces were lost, though it was later restored to its full glory by the Nerevarine. It possesses the ability to kill a god if wielded by one of noble intent."
 umbra_desc: "The Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a worthy one is found."
 vampiric_ring_desc: "One of the more deadly and rare artifacts in Tamriel is the Vampiric Ring. It is said that the Ring has the power to steal its victim's health and grant it to the wearer. The exact nature and origin of the Ring is wholly unknown, but many elders speak of its evil creation in Morrowind long, long ago by a cult of Vampire followers.

Alternatively, you can kill Vivec and have the Unique Dwemer Artifact glove found on his corpse activated as Wraithguard by Yagrum Bagarn, though not without some serious consequences for the player character due to a bug."

 blackwater_blade_desc: "Circa 3E 433, the Blade was in the possession of Selene, the leader of the Blackwater Brigands during their most daring heist involving the acquisition of the Golden Galleon, a legendary golden statuette. Ormil, the publican of the Bloated Float Inn in the Waterfront district of the Imperial City, spread a false rumor that he held this famous statue on his water-bound inn to increase business. This attracted the Blackwater Brigands, who vowed to obtain the Golden Galleon, fence it, and split the profit four ways. To accomplish this the Brigands hijacked the Bloated Float, held the publican and his bouncer hostage, and set off to sea to search for the treasure in peace and security. Little did they know that the Champion of Cyrodiil was asleep in the hold when they set off, and would awaken to foil their plan. The adventurer systematically killed the Brigands and freed Ormil and the bouncer, Graman gro-Marad. The only rumored survivor was Selene, leader of the Brigands, who surrendered the Blackwater Blade to the Champion and was incarcerated for her crimes shortly after the Bloated Float returned to the Waterfront."
 chillrend: "Chillrend"
 chillrend_desc: "Chillrend is an artifact of unknown origins. It takes the form of a glass shortsword, although, unlike regular malachite, it is blue instead of green. Like other glass weapons, its hilt was fashioned from rare metals and moonstone. Its enchantment varies in strength and properties, but it always causes magical frost damage to the opponent. Other known effects include causing a weakness to frost, or temporary paralysis. It also repairs itself when the wielder takes frost damage. The sword's first known owner was Valus Odiil, an Imperial adventurer who wandered Tamriel (or at least Hammerfell). Valus eventually settled down in Cyrodiil, and bought a farm outside the walls of Chorrol. However, his farm was continuously raided by goblins from the Great Forest, and the town guard refused to help. In 3E 433, unable to fight in his old age, he asked the Champion of Cyrodiil to aid his two sons in killing the goblins. After the battle, Valus passed on Chillrend to the Champion for keeping his sons safe, saying that he was going to spend the rest of his days in peace."
 debaser: "Debaser"
 debaser_desc: "In 3E 433, the Bosmer Thorinor opened a shop in the Imperial City's Market District, and greatly disrupted the economy by massively undercutting the competition. The cities' Society of Concerned Merchants, which was created to keep an economic balance in town, attempted to recruit the undercutter, but he refused to join. Disgruntled, the society hired a mercenary to investigate the source of Thorinor's merchandise, which they suspected was gotten by illicit means. The investigation led to the acquisition of evidence that revealed that Thorinor's dealer was not a simple trapper, but a Nordic grave digger named Agarmir. His journal revealed that he dug the graves of the wealthy in cities all across Cyrodiil. One of the items of note was the Debaser itself, taken from the resting place of a Oford Gabings from Anvil. After confronting Thorinor about his dealer, he revealed that he had no idea where Agarmir got his goods, and led the mercenary to the direction the Nord was planning to be. In reality, the gravedigger set a trap, and attempted to slay the interloper, but was put down. With the dealer gone, Thorinor joined the Society of Concerned Merchants, and donated his ill-gotten goods and the gold obtained from their sale to the Temple, thus eluding the wrath of the Imperial Watch, and helped re-stabilize the economy. Despite the Debaser being gained by gravedigging, it was kept by the Mercenary, with no efforts made to retrieve it by the Imperial Watch."

Too embarrassed to admit they were made fools of, the male victims were reluctant to speak about the incidents, leaving the situation difficult to resolve.

Hearing of these developments, Fathis Ules travelled to Chorrol and hired the Champion to recover the lost Honorblade from the ogre den at Redguard Valley Cave.[5] It is unknown if the Champion agreed to sell the blade to Fathis, or if it was instead returned to Castle Chorrol.

The Madstone appears as a snake coiled around and encircling itself. The eyes of the snake are supposed to be precious gems or some such. Through my sources, I've learned that the last reported location of the Madstone was the ruins at Pale Pass. Back at the end of the First Era, raiders from the continent of Akavir attempted to gain a foothold here in Tamriel. At that time, the Empire was broken into smaller factions. Reman Cyrodiil decided to unify them and form an army to repel the Akaviri raiders. The force became known as the Army of Reman. The two armies clashed in what's now northern Cyrodiil. The Akaviri were strong and well supplied. But their greatest error was marching through Morrowind on the way to their objective and dismissing the response it would garner from Vivec. They didn't count on Lord Vivec forming an alliance with the Trident-Kings of the Dreugh. From Morrowind, he struck at their rear flank. Not only did this make the Akaviri fight on two fronts, it also cut off access to reinforcements and supplies from the sea."
