An elven arrow tainted with the blood of a pure-blooded Daughter of Coldharbour becomes a Bloodcursed elven arrow. If fired at the Sun with Auriel's Bow, it is capable of blotting out the Sun for an entire day."

 esb_watermagic1_desc: "Water Magic is an obscure and little-known form of magic involving the manipulation of water."
 esb_watermagic2_desc: "On Tamriel, water is composed of memory. When a mortal dies, his or her memories become water, and in this way all the memories of Tamriel's histories are stored within its waters."
 esb_watermagic3_desc: "This fact is considered to be one of the most dangerous secrets about the natural order of the world, and is therefore closely guarded by the Demon of Knowledge Hermaeus Mora."
 esb_watermagic4_desc: "For example, circa 2E 582 the water spirit of Halcyon Lake, a nereid named Lorelia, attempted to twist the natural order by stealing the memories of her mortal followers to prevent the desertification of her lake, forcing the servants of Hermaeus Mora to intervene."

 esb_warmagic2_desc: "The enemy's vulnerability may be his strongest point; your weakness may enable you to strike the decisive blow."
 esb_warmagic3_desc: "When planning a campaign, take account of both the arcane and the mundane. The skillful battlemage ensures that they are in balance; a weight lifted by one hand is heavier than two weights lifted by both hands."
 esb_warmagic4_desc: "When the arcane and mundane are in balance, the army will move effortlessly, like a swinging door on well-oiled hinges. When they are out of balance, the army will be like a three-legged dog, with one leg always dragging in the dust."
 esb_warmagic5_desc: "Thus when the army strikes a blow, it will be like a thunderclap out of a cloudless sky. The best victories are those unforeseen by the enemy, but obvious to everyone afterwards."
 esb_warmagic6_desc: "The skillful battlemage ensures that the enemy is already defeated before the battle begins. A close-fought battle is to be avoided; the fortunes of war may turn aside the most powerful sorcery, and courage may undo the best-laid plans. Instead, win your victory ahead of time. When the enemy knows he is defeated before the battle begins, you may not need to fight."
 esb_warmagic7_desc: "Victory in battle is only the least kind of victory. Victory without battle is the acme of skill."
