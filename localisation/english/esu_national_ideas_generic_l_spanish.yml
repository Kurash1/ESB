 akaviri_ideas_1: "Akaviri Cunning"
 akaviri_ideas_1_desc: "Some have described the men of Akavir as 'rat-like', typically taken to literally mean they looked like humanoid rats, but by no means confirmed one way or the other. Regardless of their physical appearance, Akaviri's cunning certainly seems to fit that description."

 arachnid_ideas_2: "Excitable yet Unstable"
 arachnid_ideas_2_desc: "Spider Daedra are difficult to control, even by their masters- their boundless energy is likely part of the cause for this, but that is a boon of its own."
 arachnid_ideas_3: "Silken Words"
 arachnid_ideas_3_desc: "Spider Daedra are known to speak kindly and sweetly despite their disposition. Regardless of how obvious their true nature may be, some will inevitably fall prey to their silken words."

 ashlander_ideas_1: "The God-King of the Chimer" 
 ashlander_ideas_1_desc: "Boethiah, the Prince of Plots, played a key role in the formation of the Chimer identity by convincing them to abandon their Aldmer heritage, and forge a new path for themselves elsewhere."
 ashlander_ideas_2: "The Great Exodus"
 ashlander_ideas_2_desc: "Spurred by religious turmoil, the prophet Veloth departed the Summerset Isles with his followers, leading them on an arduous journey - first by sea, and then on foot - into Morrowind. While many perished on the way, Veloth's charisma and leadership prevailed, and his remaining followers emerged from the Velothi mountains a stubborn and resourceful people."

 ashlander_ideas_4: "The Web-Spinner"
 ashlander_ideas_4_desc: "While there is no doubt that Boethiah is chief among the three \"Good Daedra\", one cannot discount the influence that Mephala has over the Chimer. Velothi tradition tells of how Mephala was the one to teach them about the shadowy arts of evasion and assassination."
 ashlander_ideas_5: "Dwemer Neighbours"
 ashlander_ideas_5_desc: "The Chimer lived in close proximity to the Dwemer for centuries, even forming a joint-kingdom known as Resdayn. Despite their differences and disagreements, the Chimer could not help but feel the influence of the Dwemer on their culture."
 ashlander_ideas_6: "Velothi Towers"
 ashlander_ideas_6_desc: "In the early days of the Chimer, Boethiah taught them - among many other things - the ways of \"responsible\" architecture.

 ashlander_ideas_7: "Precursors of the Great Houses"
 ashlander_ideas_7_desc: "The Chimer began as a people who were disillusioned with the ways of the old Aldmer society. Ironically, it wasn't long before Chimer society developed dissidents of its own - mer who eschewed the deeply religious, daedra-worshipping way of life in favour of a more secular lifestyle. Eventually, the Chimer who spearheaded this division evolved into the great houses of Morrowind - some of which survive to this day."

 ayleid_ideas_bonus: "Ayleid Ambition"
 ayleid_ideas_1: "Summerset Heritage"
 ayleid_ideas_1_desc: "The Ayleids left Summerset sometime deep in the Merethic era. However, that seems to have not affected their sense of Elven superiority."
 ayleid_ideas_2: "Slave Drivers"
 ayleid_ideas_2_desc: "The Ayleids kept the Nedes of Cyrodiil subjugated and enslaved for centuries, up until the successful slave rebellion which overthrew the Ayleids and formed the Alessian Empire in the First Era."
 ayleid_ideas_3: "Cruel Masters"
 ayleid_ideas_3_desc: "Some Ayleids, particularly the ones who worshipped Daedric Princes like Molag Bal and Mehrunes Dagon, were vicious and cruel masters to their slaves. Terrible reports come to us through the ages of beatings, killings, and horrific acts of torture. Their twisted methods were known by such names as 'Wailing Wheels', 'Gut Gardens', and 'Flesh Sculptures'. One shudders to imagine what horrors those acts entailed."
 ayleid_ideas_4: "Meteoric Glass"
 ayleid_ideas_4_desc: "Some time in the Merethic past, Ayleid Sorcerers stumbled upon the innate magical properties of Meteoric Glass - a rare form of Aetherial Fragment. This highly prized material could be fashioned into useful devices such as Welkynd stones, Varla Stones, and several other similar trinkets. A Welkynd Stone served as a font of Magicka from which a mage could replenish their own reserves, while a Varla stone allowed even an inexperienced magic user to recharge enchanted items. The Ayleids were even said to have learned the process of cultivating the glass crystals so that their limited supply could be grown and multiplied, although nothing is known about the methods they used to achieve this."
 ayleid_ideas_5: "Ayleid City-States"
 ayleid_ideas_5_desc: "Cyrodiil (or Cyrod, as it was known to the Ayleids), was once home to dozens of Ayleid cities which were scattered all across the region. Eventually, these cities coalesced into an empire ruled by powerful sorcerer-kings."
 ayleid_ideas_6: "Holy Light"
 ayleid_ideas_6_desc: "The Ayleids believed that Light was the most sacred of the four basic elements (the others being Earth, Water, and Air). In particular, they believed that starlight was a particularly pure and potent form of light, and would build special 'wells' which supposedly captured the power of starlight. Meridia, or Merid-Nunda in Ayleidoon, was accordingly worshipped with special attention due to her association with Light in all of its forms."
 ayleid_ideas_7: "Chim-el Adabal"
 ayleid_ideas_7_desc: "The Ayleids were the builders of the White-Gold tower - one of eight Towers to be found on Tamriel which keep Mundus stabilized, and which was built in imitation of the original Tower known as the Adamantine Tower. The stone of White-Gold - a fiery-red gem in the shape of a diamond - is called Chim-el Adabal, and is thought to be made of a crystallized drop of Lorkhan's blood. The stone was later made into the Amulet of Kings and gifted to Alessia by Akatosh as a symbol of his favour, and to represent the legitimacy of the coming empires of men."

 breton_ideas_1_desc: "Bretons are thought to be a race of elf-men, unique among the humans of Tamriel by being able to point to a partially elven heritage."
 breton_ideas_2: "Shifting Alliances"
 breton_ideas_2_desc: "The many petty-kingdoms and city-states of High Rock engage in an intricate dance of temporary alliances, political marriages, and back-stabbing betrayals. Be warned; nascent powers rise quickly - and old mainstays fall even quicker."
 breton_ideas_3: "Iliac Bay"
 breton_ideas_3_desc: "High Rock is practically defined by the great inlet which separates it from Hammerfell - most commonly known as Iliac Bay. Its waters have seen many an invading armada, but also more peaceful times where humble fishermen drag its depths, and merchant vessels cut across the waves between the countless city-states and kingdoms that line its shores."
 breton_ideas_4: "The High King"
 breton_ideas_4_desc: "Occasionally, a warlord manages to unite the disparate realms of High Rock under one banner."

 clannfear_ideas_bonus: "Clannfear Ambition"
 clannfear_ideas_1: "Simplest Ones"
 clannfear_ideas_1_desc: "Clannfear are one of the simplest Daedra- although, this means that they can get away with quite a bit before being seen as a threat."
 clannfear_ideas_2: "Defensive Frills and Boneplates"
 clannfear_ideas_2_desc: "The frills that adorn Clannfear necks do not contain much in the way of vitals. They can be hit, pierced, or bashed, only causing slight harm to the Clannfear, preventing more vital areas such as the torso from being harmed.\nIn addition to their frills, Clannfear are also adorned with various protrusions of bone, which can help to catch blades and sharp objects before they can puncture flesh."
 clannfear_ideas_3: "Talons for Digging and Tails for Tilling"
 clannfear_ideas_3_desc: "Clannfear can either be trained to or learn themselves to landscape and shape the world with their talons or use their tails to till the soil. The Clannfear body is an effective instrument in increasing the productivity of the land they live on."
 clannfear_ideas_4: "Unique Frills"
 clannfear_ideas_4_desc: "While some may assume Clannfear frills are simply for protection, that may not be their origin. Differences in Clannfear frills help mark distinctions between groups, and can be important in finding mates and pack-members."
 clannfear_ideas_5: "Clannfear Charge"
 clannfear_ideas_5_desc: "The heads of Clannfear are specially designed to batter and puncture those that they ram. The Daedra's heads are comparable to an arrowhead- sharp at the point and flaring outwards to dig into and stay in the flesh."
 clannfear_ideas_6: "Receptive Beasts"
 clannfear_ideas_6_desc: "While the Clannfear are not the most intelligent, they are quite capable of picking up on commands and training from other races. The Clannfear are even able to employ this when they subjugate those supposedly \"higher\" than them, extracting wisdom that they have trouble developing themselves."
 clannfear_ideas_7: "Matriarch System"
 clannfear_ideas_7_desc: "Some of the Clannfear are known to follow Matriarchs which help guide them and organize their roles. These Matriarchs can help achieve better cohesion in Clannfear groups."

 colovian_ideas_1: "The Colovian Landscape"
 colovian_ideas_1_desc: "Colovia encompasses the eastern half of Cyrodiil, from the rugged Colovian Highlands in the north to the coves and inlets of the Golden Coast, and the thick oak forests and fields of the West Weald."
 colovian_ideas_2: "Nordic Heritage"
 colovian_ideas_2_desc: "In contrast to their Nibenese counterparts, the Colovians have held on to their Nordic heritage in greater measure. They are stern and tough like the landscape, with an excellent work ethic, and a martial culture that makes them formidable warriors and leaders."
 colovian_ideas_3: "The Ruins of Miscarand"
 colovian_ideas_3_desc: "Colovia is home to the largest Ayleid ruins in the whole of Cyrodiil - the Ruins of Miscarand."
 colovian_ideas_4: "Merchants of the Gold Coast"
 colovian_ideas_4_desc: "Colovia's Gold Coast, in particular the city of Anvil, is a major trading region for Western Tamriel. Most trade entering Cyrodiil from Hammerfell and High Rock will pass through one of its many port towns. These towns also serve as places to stock up and rest for traders who are simply taking a north-south trade route along the west coast."
 colovian_ideas_5: "Varen's Wall"
 colovian_ideas_5_desc: "Duke Varen Aquilarios built a great stone wall partitioning the region in order to defend against the lawlessness that had sprung during the uncertain years of the Interregnum."
 colovian_ideas_6: "The Colovian Estates"
 colovian_ideas_6_desc: "The Colovian Estates typically refer to the core Colovian cities of Anvil, Chorrol, Kvatch, and Skingrad which were ruled by merchant-lords, before being subjugated into the Empire. These estates, while primarily focused on trade, had no qualms about marching to war in order to secure their borders or enforce terms of a trading agreement."
 colovian_ideas_7: "Colovian Wine"
 colovian_ideas_7_desc: "Colovia is now well known for its agriculture, except when it comes to wine. The dry and rocky soil which inhibits the growth of other products is perfect for winemaking, and accordingly, the region is home to several quality vineyards - particularly in the region around Skingrad."

 daedroth_ideas_2: "Ambush Tactics"
 daedroth_ideas_2_desc: "Daedroth, much like crocodiles, are known to use ambush tactics and leap out unexpectedly towards the enemy. While they cannot hide underneath the water, they can still hide behind buildings and rock formations."
 daedroth_ideas_3: "Crocodile Tears"
 daedroth_ideas_3_desc: "\"O woe to those we conquer- to those we crush under our heels and devastate utterly! We weep for them!\""
 daedroth_ideas_4: "Bestial Daedra"
 daedroth_ideas_4_desc: "Daedroth are not quite as intelligent as the Xivilai or the Dremora, but they make up for it in their raw bestial strength."
 daedroth_ideas_5: "Daedroth Brawn"
 daedroth_ideas_5_desc: "The hulking Daedroth can be quite industrious with their strength. With their brawn, they can easily carry about heavy chunks of material from place to place and operate large tools and machinery."
 daedroth_ideas_6: "Terrifying Presence"
 daedroth_ideas_6_desc: "The monstrous appearance of the Daedroth can go a long way to ensuring the authority of any state or polity they form - although this aggressive disposition may be disruptive to their relations with other polities..."
 daedroth_ideas_7: "Affinity to Water"
 daedroth_ideas_7_desc: "Daedroth are generally not familiar with large bodies of water. Despite this, if ever were the two to meet, it is possible they would go together swimmingly."

 dremoran_ideas: "Dremoran Ideas"
 dremoran_ideas_start: "Dremoran Traditions"
 dremoran_ideas_bonus: "Dremoran Ambition"
 dremoran_ideas_1: "Strict Hierarchies"
 dremoran_ideas_1_desc: "Dremoran Society is fundamentally defined by the ordering things into their natural place. This means that a Dremora must submit to their betters without complaint, and likewise expect submission from those who are below their station."
 dremoran_ideas_2: "Haughty Nature"
 dremoran_ideas_2_desc: "A Dremora who knows his place is fully permitted, even expected, to carry themselves with arrogance and confidence when interacting with underlings."
 dremoran_ideas_3: "Swords and Spells"
 dremoran_ideas_3_desc: "Every Dremora is familiar with the many instruments of war, be they physical or magical in nature."
 dremoran_ideas_4: "Bred for War"
 dremoran_ideas_4_desc: "A Dremora's existence is typically spent training and preparing for battle, whether that conflict is of their own choosing or of their master's. Furthermore, they have no fear of death as they will always reform back in their overlord's plane of oblivion - although this process may take longer for more grievous circumstances of death."
 dremoran_ideas_5: "Oath-keepers"
 dremoran_ideas_5_desc: "While they may seem base and unprincipled, Dremora are actually creatures of their word. An oath made is wholly binding to a Dremora, and woe to them that breaks a vow of allegiance to their master."

 great_house_ideas_start: "Great House Traditions"
 great_house_ideas_bonus: "Great House Ambition"
 great_house_ideas_1: "Settled Lifestyle"
 great_house_ideas_1_desc: "The Great Houses emerged as a movement within Ashlander society which had grown to view the traditional ways as outdated, and desired to settle down and build a more modern civilization for themselves. While the Ashlanders continued their nomadic lifestyle, several prominent families who would become the Great Houses began to construct permanent settlements for themselves, which in time grew to become the great political and economic centres of Morrowind such as Balmora, Ald'ruhn, Necrom, and Mournhold."
 great_house_ideas_2: "Great House Retainers"
 great_house_ideas_2_desc: "The Great Houses are inherently war-like in nature, and each is expected to keep loyal retainers ready at all times to deal with threats. House members are trained from a young age in the usage of swords, spears, and shields, and many also are skilled in destruction magic."
 great_house_ideas_3: "Slave Markets"
 great_house_ideas_3_desc: "The trade of Slaves is one of the defining features of Great House culture, whether on Vvardenfell or on the mainland. If you weren't one of the houses raiding the border regions (particularly Shadowfen) for slaves to sell, then you were one of the many houses buying slaves to staff your households or to work your plantations."
 great_house_ideas_4: "Great House Rivalries"
 great_house_ideas_4_desc: "Squabbling and feuding amongst each other are one of the most popular Great House pastimes. Infighting between the Great Houses grew to be so rampant that an entire organization of professional (and legal) assassins known as the Morag Tong became a mainstay of Great House life. If you have a grudge against someone, you could legally pay to have them killed. Such an environment led to the Great Houses developing expansive networks of spies to keep tabs on the goings-on of the other houses, lest they catch an assassin's dagger in their sleep. Surprisingly, one of the functions of such a system is to avoid widespread bloodshed; according to legend, Mephala advised the early Great Houses to settle disputes between rulers directly, rather than dragging the rest of their house into a war which would lead to the deaths of others who had no part in the original conflict."
 great_house_ideas_5: "Bonemold Armour"
 great_house_ideas_5_desc: "The Great Houses developed a new type of armour which expanded on the concepts of Ashlander chitin and netch leather armour. Known as \"Bonemold Armour\", it was made from real bone which was treated with a resin and moulded into plating which formed the main protective surfaces of the armour. It was an exceptionally strong and lightweight material, and is favoured by Great House armourers even today."
 great_house_ideas_6: "Ancestral Tombs"
 great_house_ideas_6_desc: "Like the Ashlanders, the Great Houses carried on the ancient tradition of venerating their ancestors. While most folk could only afford to keep a small shrine in their homes, the wealthiest would build extensive Ancestral Tomb complexes which served to house the earthly remains of their dead, as well as provide a place where their descendants can come and give offerings and pay their respects."
 great_house_ideas_7: "The Grand Council"
 great_house_ideas_7_desc: "The Grand Council is a ruling body made up of the heads of the Great Houses which guide Morrowind's foreign policy. The Council has the power to appoint a Hortator from their ranks to lead their combined armies, although this rarely happens since a single dissenting vote will veto the appointment."

 harvester_ideas_1: "Focus on the Fight"

 harvester_ideas_4: "Ebony Attunement"
 harvester_ideas_4_desc: "Ebony is etched into the being of Harvesters, it covering them and protecting them from harm. Harvesters know best how to extract and shape ebony into various forms to suit their needs."
 harvester_ideas_5: "Spirit Soldiers"
 harvester_ideas_5_desc: "A Harvester is capable of resurrecting their fallen foes as allies. The spirits the Daedra summon are bound entirely to their being, and have no choice on fighting those they are turned on, even their former allies."
 harvester_ideas_6: "Solitary Serpents"
 harvester_ideas_6_desc: "Harvesters do not care much for their neighbours, only interacting with those around them when necessary. This also translates roughly into a \"live and let live\" mentality for their subjects- although it may be more accurate to call it a \"die and let die\" mentality."
 harvester_ideas_7: "Deathly Embrace"
 harvester_ideas_7_desc: "The Harvester's body is cold and jagged, full of pain and hate. Those that spend too much time engaged in combat with a Harvester will find themselves in the Harvesters' deathly coils, bleeding out in body and spirit."

 sinistral_elves_ideas_4_desc: "The Sinistral Elves and their Yokudan rivals were fierce enemies, and both had plans to exterminate each other lest the same should happen to them first."

 sload_ideas_1: "Thras Endures"
 sload_ideas_1_desc: "Like a loathsome pox, Thras and its inhabitants will always return unless they are wiped out entirely. It is quite possible that even if the islands were sunk, any surviving Sload would raise it from the sea's floor."
 sload_ideas_2: "Advanced Intellect"
 sload_ideas_2_desc: "The Sload mind, while slow-moving and cautious, is highly intelligent. This high intelligence helps the Sload to develop technology better than any other."
 sload_ideas_3: "Noxious Fumes"
 sload_ideas_3_desc: "Toxic gasses and horrible plagues are how the Sload wage war on their enemies. The Sload truly engage in war in a most deplorable manner."
 sload_ideas_4: "Skilled Actors"
 sload_ideas_4_desc: "Despite having no sense of morality or honour, the Sload are skilled actors and know how to manipulate and control those that do have moral compunctions."
 sload_ideas_5: "Deliberate Engagements"
 sload_ideas_5_desc: "When Sloads make direct engagements in war — which is not often — they are careful to plan them out thoroughly. This, combined with their natural blobby sluggishness makes them much slower to get in and out of said engagements, but they are much more defended and less likely to come into harm due to their cautious planning."
 sload_ideas_6: "Irreligious Society"
 sload_ideas_6_desc: "While Sloads are willing to make use of Daedra and potentially other divine beings, they do not exactly have concepts such as \"faith\" or \"worship\". Those that encounter the Sload may be eager to refer to them as \"godless\", while the Sload themselves may consider themselves \"pragmatic\"."
 sload_ideas_7: "Destabilizing Influence"
 sload_ideas_7_desc: "With the horrible diseases they create and the words they use to twist kin against one another, the Sload are a destructive influence to those who live on Nirn with them."

 snow_elven_ideas_2: "Homeland of Snow"
 snow_elven_ideas_2_desc: "Snow Elves are said to have adapted to the cold climate of their homeland in Skyrim so well, that the cold and ice no longer had any effect on them at all."
 snow_elven_ideas_3: "Auri-El Almighty"
 snow_elven_ideas_3_desc: "Auri-El is the undisputed chief deity in Snow Elf theology. Though they share their pantheon with their Altmer cousins, only the Snow Elves venerate Auri-El to such extreme lengths."
 snow_elven_ideas_4: "Monuments of Stone"
 snow_elven_ideas_4_desc: "The Snow Elves left behind many imposing structures and monuments. Even long after their heyday in the Merethic Era, the Snow Elves were able to build impressive structures like the Chantry of Auri-El and the Great Statue of Irkngthand."
 snow_elven_ideas_5: "The Way of the Pilgrim"
 snow_elven_ideas_5_desc: "Snow Elves wishing to prove their devotion would occasionally make pilgrimages to holy sites dedicated to their gods; in particular the Great Chantry of Auri-El in the Forgotten Vale. These pilgrims would follow an arduous path that required them to tap into their deepest reserves of strength and determination in order to complete it. On the way, they visit wayshrines where they learn esoteric mantras that will aid them in their quest for enlightenment."
 snow_elven_ideas_6: "Skilled Botanists"
 snow_elven_ideas_6_desc: "The Snow-Cedar, which can grow in harsh environments such as the heart of a frozen glacier, is the result of decades of careful selective breeding by the Snow Elves. Such botanical skill allows the Snow Elves to prosper even in the harshest of environments."
 snow_elven_ideas_7: "Chantries and Wayshrines"
 snow_elven_ideas_7_desc: "Snow elves are known to build Chantries - special religious centres which are dedicated to an individual. A famous chantry called the Great Chantry of Auri-El is known to exist in the Forgotten Vale, nestled in the Druadach Mountains. Snow-elf pilgrims would journey between special wayshrines on their way up to the chantry to do penance or fulfil other religious obligations. These establishments became key places of refuge for the few Snow Elves who somehow evaded the axes of the Nords and the chains of the Dwemer."

They fear neither death nor pain, and can be dangerous enough that even certain Daedra fear them."
 soul_shriven_ideas_7: "The Anuic Soul"
 soul_shriven_ideas_7_desc: "In times when Nirn is in great peril, it is said that a Soul Shriven-to-be with the correct Anuic valence can reform a perfect replica of their original body from the Chaotic Creatia, rather than forming a regular Soul Shriven. Such a soul is also potentially able to regain their physical body if they were to properly attune themselves with Nirn again."

 tsaesci_ideas_1_desc: "The Tsaesci are experts at the shadowy art of subterfuge."
 tsaesci_ideas_2: "The Serpentine Ways of Making"
 tsaesci_ideas_2_desc: "Tsaesci armour is unlike any to be found elsewhere on Nirn. Its most striking feature is the use of fearsome masked helms which cover the wearer's face with a terrifying visage. They are typically also adorned with horns or other protrusions. The style of Tsaesci armour heavily influenced the armour of the Dragonguard, and the later Blades and the techniques of its construction were incorporated into Imperial arms and armour."
 tsaesci_ideas_3: "The Proof of Wisdom"
 tsaesci_ideas_3_desc: "The Tsaesci celebrate a holiday called \"The Proving Festival\" where they demonstrate their worth to their ancestors. It consists of three proofs that showcase the participants' skills. The final proof which must be completed is called 'The Proof of Wisdom', and serves to demonstrate intellectual prowess. It may be fulfilled through the writing of essays, composition of poems, or by participating in debates or riddle competitions."

Thereafter, for several centuries, the Empire in Cyrodiil was ruled by Tsaesci rulers known as Potentates. Their rule was marked by brutal repression of the remaining Reman loyalists, although these efforts were a considerable burden on the imperial treasury."

 vampire_ideas_1: "Children of Molag Bal"
 vampire_ideas_1_desc: "The first vampire was created sometime in the late Merethic Era, or the early First Era. It is said that Molag Bal himself travelled to Nirn, brutally raped a young Nedic woman, and then left. The young woman was called Lamae, and shortly after her assault became corrupted and began to thirst for blood.\n\nAs horrible as their origins may be, the association with such a powerful Daedric prince is undoubtedly a mark of honour - at least among those where it is not met with horror and disgust."
 vampire_ideas_2: "Bloodlust"
 vampire_ideas_2_desc: "Vampires are driven by a primal desire to feed on the blood of living things, especially that of Humans and Mer."

 vampire_ideas_4: "Vampiric Strength"
 vampire_ideas_4_desc: "Vampires have unnatural strength and speed which they use to great effect in hunting down their prey."
 vampire_ideas_5: "Thralls"
 vampire_ideas_5_desc: "The constant need for blood can be problematic for vampires who wish to integrate with normal society and even those who lead a more solitary existence. A particularly common solution to this problem is to maintain some captives (magically or through more traditional means) who are fed off of, but not killed. These \"Thralls\", as they are known, usually fulfil a secondary role as servants and labourers on top of their duties as walking meals."
 vampire_ideas_6: "Blood Magic"
 vampire_ideas_6_desc: "Vampires are often skilled in magic unique to vampires such as the ability to heal by draining an enemy's life force, or to de-materialize into a cloud of bats. They are also typically skilled in the school of destruction magic."
 vampire_ideas_7: "Vampire Lords"
 vampire_ideas_7_desc: "Even among vampires, there are some that rise above their brethren to unimaginable heights of power. Certain bloodlines are blessed by Molag Bal with incredible abilities such as shape-shifting, flight, and enhanced combat skills.

 xivilai_ideas_1: "Unbound Xivilai"
 xivilai_ideas_1_desc: "Xivilai have a tendency to become disloyal and betray their masters when they feel they are not being given the proper respect. While they make for powerful commanders and knights, their temperament can make them dangerous subjects for their overlords."
 xivilai_ideas_2: "Professional Attitude"
 xivilai_ideas_2_desc: "It would be an understatement to say that the Xivilai hold themselves in high regard- and others as below them. This is not all bluster, though, as the Xivilai try to maintain strict standards for themselves."
 xivilai_ideas_3: "Xivilai Pomp"
 xivilai_ideas_3_desc: "The pompousness of the Xivilai may be off-putting to some, but to others, it can go a long way towards commanding respect and authority."
 xivilai_ideas_4: "Xivilai Duality"
 xivilai_ideas_4_desc: "Many Xivilai have another that they are paired with, either having come into being with their pair- making them twins- or simply having met with another Xivilai they can tolerate enough to call their partner. These pairs have great coordination between each other, allowing them to either work jointly to great effect, or swap places in times of need."
 xivilai_ideas_5: "Of Many Trades"
 xivilai_ideas_5_desc: "Xivilai are not bound by the same military hierarchy as their Dremoran cousins. These Daedra are much freer to set off into various roles, some even becoming merchants amongst mortals."
 xivilai_ideas_6: "Dedicated Knights"
 xivilai_ideas_6_desc: "As everything regarding the Xivilai, they hold their soldiers to a high standard as well. Not seeing themselves fit to be common conscripts, the Xivilai instead prefer the role of highly paid professional knights."
 xivilai_ideas_7: "Dominion Over the Weak"
 xivilai_ideas_7_desc: "Xivilai are known to summon and command other Daedra, such as atronachs and bestial Daedra. While this means they have better control over the Daedra \"below them\", it also means they are able to use those Daedra to keep others in line- such as mortals from Nirn."

 yokudan_ideas_2: "The Way of the Sword"
 yokudan_ideas_2_desc: "Indeed, perhaps the only thing which can be said to best their naval prowess is the Yokudans' love of the Sword and swordplay. An entire martial tradition is known as \"Sword-singing\" developed out of the Yokudans' desire to end the civil wars which plagued their society. Master sword-singers were known as the \"Ansei\", and are said to have possessed incredible abilities - even the ability to materialize a sword made up of their very soul. Swordsmanship was such an integral part of Yokudan culture that depictions of swords and fighting men can be found on even the most mundane objects in Yokuda."
 yokudan_ideas_3: "An Ancient Civilization"
 yokudan_ideas_3_desc: "The Yokudans of old built an empire for themselves while Nords and Nedes of Tamriel were still in their infancy. They built cities resplendent with gardens and grand monuments, and had a rich literary tradition."
 yokudan_ideas_4: "The Far Shores"
 yokudan_ideas_4_desc: "The Far Shores are the Yokudans' version of the afterlife. It is the domain of their death god, Tu'whacca, and a place of safety for the souls of Yokudans who have passed on. All immaterial needs they may have are taken care of, and they are given opportunities to continually hone their martial skills - even in death."
 yokudan_ideas_5: "The Ra Gada"
 yokudan_ideas_5_desc: "The \"Warrior Wave\" - more commonly known as the Ra Gada - was a series of four successive invasions of Hammerfell by Yokudans fleeing persecution and imperial overreach. Thousands of warriors poured across the sea to carve a new home for themselves out of the ashes of Goblin and Nedic settlements, and over time, corrupted the term Ra Gada into the more familiar \"Redguard\" - the name of Hammerfell's current inhabitants."
 yokudan_ideas_6: "Monumental Tombs"
 yokudan_ideas_6_desc: "The sheer scale and grandeur of Yokudan funerary architecture is rivalled by no other known civilization, except perhaps by the ancient Nord barrows."
 yokudan_ideas_7: "The Book of Circles"
 yokudan_ideas_7_desc: "The Book of Circles was a book meant to record the lifetime of wisdom and knowledge acquired by the legendary Yokudan and Redguard hero Frandar Hunding. While the treatise contains some tracts on philosophy and other topics, it is primarily concerned with the art of Swordsmanship generally, and Sword-singing in particular. It is a staple of modern Redguard households, and is highly respected as a manual even in other martial disciplines."

 argonian_ideas_start: "Argonian Traditions"
 argonian_ideas_bonus: "Argonian Ambition"
 argonian_ideas_1: "Days of Stone-Nest"
 argonian_ideas_1_desc: "Tales come to us of an ancient Saxhleel civilization in Black Marsh, predating almost all empires of Man or Mer on Tamriel. These ancient Argonians built cities of huge stone ziggurats known as Xanmeers, mastered various schools of magic, and organized themselves into a complex society of city-states. Curiously, we don't know what caused the decline of this civilization - now known as The Duskfall - as the Argonians themselves have no recollection of it."
 argonian_ideas_2: "Black Marsh"
 argonian_ideas_2_desc: "While other groups have only managed to survive in its thick jungles and treacherous swamps, Black Marsh is a true home to the Argonians. They are naturally resistant to the myriad diseases that plague (literally) any outsider who dares venture too far from the relatively hospitable coast. Its many hidden coves and inlets also make enticing hideaways for smugglers and bandits."
 argonian_ideas_3: "The Nisswo"
 argonian_ideas_3_desc: "In Argonian society, the Nisswo have played different roles at different times. In the ancient past, during the age of Saxhleel civilization, the Nisswo made up the ruling class - known then as Nisswo-Kings. Apart from the ruling, their duties included the vital task of appeasing Sithis' lust for destruction and chaos, which they achieved through constant sacrifices in his name. Eventually, after undergoing the events of The Duskfall, the Nisswo lost their status as rulers and transitioned into solely filling their priestly roles."
 argonian_ideas_4: "The Hist"
 argonian_ideas_4_desc: "\"The narrow reed you call real cannot hold the Hist's truth, Rootmender. Real. Illusion. Dream. Waking. These are the words that keep our bellies to the mud. We are safe there, yes. But we cannot see very far.\"\n—Sap-Speaker Kuzei"
 argonian_ideas_5: "Root-Heralds"
 argonian_ideas_5_desc: "Many Argonians in Black Marsh utilize \"Root-Heralds\" - special members of the tribe who serve as its eyes and ears to the outside world. The Argonians themselves think of them as ambassadors, but some outsiders can't help but see them as spies."
 argonian_ideas_6: "Daedric Invaders"
 argonian_ideas_6_desc: "During the Oblivion Crisis of the Third Era, the Hist summoned many Argonians back to Black Marsh to organize its defence against the Daedric hordes. Legend claims that their defence was so furious that they quickly turned back their foe, and even pursued them through the gates back to Oblivion! Their actions forced the Daedra to shut their gates in Black Marsh in order to prevent further casualties, making the Argonians one of the few races to be relatively unharmed by Mehrunes Dagon's invasion."
 argonian_ideas_7: "Shadow-Scales"
 argonian_ideas_7_desc: "The Shadow-Scales are an elite order of Argonian assassins. They are selected at birth, being those born under the sign of the Shadow, and trained by the Dark Brotherhood in their dark ways."

 bosmer_ideas_2: "Guerrilla Tactics"
 bosmer_ideas_2_desc: "The Bosmer although a peaceful people are extremely aggressive when defending their lands and foes willing to invade them must face heavy resistance."
 bosmer_ideas_3: "Enforce the Green Pact"
 bosmer_ideas_3_desc: "Although the Bosmer are very welcoming to strangers and Migrants, placating the Green is a vital part of life in Valenwood, as the forests will often turn against the residents when the Pact is broken or the Valenwood is otherwise harmed. To atone and stop the Green's assault, the clan responsible for that area of land must hold a trial and the party found guilty of violating the Green Pact must be sacrificed to the Green itself, regardless of how limited their involvement was or even whether they were a Bosmer."
 bosmer_ideas_4: "Traders or Pirates"
 bosmer_ideas_4_desc: "The Bosmer are heavily dependent on good relations and trade with other races, as the Green Pact forces them to import the timber needed to make their homes, arrows, and other wooden instruments. Their resources for trade include hides, river pearls, and finger-bone charms made from the Magically-charged hands of their dead wizards. When they are at odds with Colovia or other trading allies, they are said to rely on piracy or banditry to get what they need."
 bosmer_ideas_5: "All are Welcomed"
 bosmer_ideas_5_desc: "The Bosmer welcome anyone that wishes to integrate themselves in their society as long as they are willing to follow their rules and customs, also the Bosmer are relatively prone to producing offspring. As a result, they outnumber all other Mer on Tamriel."
 bosmer_ideas_6: "Best Archers"
 bosmer_ideas_6_desc: "The Bosmer are undoubtedly the best archers of Tamriel some even say they were the ones who invented the bow, regardless of its origin their prowess is undeniable."
 bosmer_ideas_7: "The Greenspeakers"
 bosmer_ideas_7_desc: "Greenspeakers are mages who dedicate their lives to working in and alongside the Green itself. They use their spells to guide and enhance the growth of trees and plants, and can create furniture and housing for their people in doing so."

 dwemer_ideas_bonus: "Dwemer Ambition"
 dwemer_ideas_1: "The Deep Folk"
 dwemer_ideas_1_desc: "The Dwemer make their homes in vast, rock-cut networks of finely crafted tunnels, halls, and antechambers. Accordingly, they have mastered the art of stone carving, mining, and excavation."
 dwemer_ideas_2: "Arcanex"
 dwemer_ideas_2_desc: "\"Arcanex are typically smaller structures. Very few have been properly studied before disruption by grave-robbers or greedy adventurers, but those few undisturbed sites have contained a surprising collection of magical objects, such as soul gems, alchemical concoctions, and magical texts. Some scholars take these as evidence that the Dwemer did, in fact, dabble in the magical arts. Based on what we know of their culture, as well as the fact that most arcanex are minor structures compared to other common fixtures, I would suggest that these were centres of study and nothing more. Perhaps the Dwarves established these halls as a means to study Men and Mer, who surely seemed as alien to them as the Dwemer seems to us today.\"\n-Thelwe Ghelein, \"Dwemer Inquiries: Volume II\"\n"
 dwemer_ideas_3: "Dwemer Automatons"
 dwemer_ideas_3_desc: "The Dwemer delegated menial tasks, such as guard duty, to one of their signature inventions - mechanical creatures known as \"automatons\". These marvels of engineering are constructed of a long-lost alloy unique to the Dwemer, and powered and controlled by unknown sources. To this day, these machines bide their time in the dark passages of Dwemer ruins, waiting to eviscerate any intruder unfortunate enough to stumble across one."
 dwemer_ideas_4: "Tonal Architecture"
 dwemer_ideas_4_desc: "\"At the height of their power, the Dwemer exhibited near-total mastery of tonal forces. Even now, countless centuries later, they remain peerless in this respect. Sound, not magic, facilitated their rise to power. I am continually astounded by tonal forces' wide range of uses. The Dwemer used sound in mining, medicine, architecture—even psychology. It's the latter use that I find most intriguing. According to ancient Chimeri scholarship, the Dwemer could employ tonal forces to bend weaker minds to their will—a form of complex aural hypnosis. Luckily, the Dwarves never managed to mobilize this technology on the battlefield against our august ancestors. The scale and complexity of the devices likely made transportation nearly impossible. But they still managed to employ it on a limited scale using massive devices called Tonal Resonators.\"\n—Vorinara Kleeve, Dwemer Scholar, \"A Guide to Dwemer Mega-Structures\"\n"
 dwemer_ideas_5: "Culture of Learning"
 dwemer_ideas_5_desc: "The Dwemer highly value education, reason, and logic, and their society produces many bright individuals as a result."
 dwemer_ideas_6: "Dwemer Craftsmanship"
 dwemer_ideas_6_desc: "The Dwemer are known over the world for their craftsmanship of the highest quality. In particular, their skill in working with metals and creating useful alloys is unparalleled. The pairing of these unique metals with Dwemer industriousness and engineering means that arms and armour manufactured by the Dwemer are some of the finest you can get your hands on."
 dwemer_ideas_7: "Dwemer Freeholds"
 dwemer_ideas_7_desc: "In 1E 420, clan Rourken set out from Morrowind to establish a homeland for themselves away from the Chimer, whom they detested, and eventually settled around Hammerfell. Shortly afterwards, clan Kagren undertook a similar journey which led them to establish many colonies across the province of Skyrim."

 giant_ideas_2: "Colossal Strength"
 giant_ideas_2_desc: "Unsurprisingly given their size, Giants possess great strength of limb that is completely unmatched by any other race."
 giant_ideas_3: "Great Shepherds"
 giant_ideas_3_desc: "Giants are known to tend herds of Cows which they keep for milk and other dairy products, as well as to occasionally slaughter for meat. Giants also have a special relationship with the large Mammoths that roam the tundra. The Giants don't \"own\" the Mammoths per se, rather the Mammoths choose to keep close to Giants, giving of their own dairy products in exchange for protection."
 giant_ideas_4: "The Spiral Motif"
 giant_ideas_4_desc: "Anybody who has spent time in Skyrim's tundra can attest to the many carven and painted spirals left by Giants on stones and trees. Giants are also fond of tattooing or scarring the motif onto tools, and even their bodies. The meaning of this symbol is not fully understood; it could have spiritual significance, or it could simply be a creative expression."
 giant_ideas_5: "Treasure Hordes"
 giant_ideas_5_desc: "At the heart of every Giant encampment there can be found a collection of all their most prized possessions, including the valuables of any person foolish enough to cross them."
 giant_ideas_6: "Sacred Burial Grounds"
 giant_ideas_6_desc: "It would be easy to dismiss Giants as dull and brutish, but one must not forget the subtleties and complexities that even the simplest of minds can comprehend. Giants seem to have a deep understanding of, and respect for, the circumstances of death that every living thing faces. In particular, they utilise special burial grounds which are reserved solely for that purpose. Giants that know they are dying will make their way to one of these locations to live out their final days, and if death is more sudden, then they will be brought thereafter death by their peers."
 giant_ideas_7: "Atmoran Heritage"
 giant_ideas_7_desc: "There are theories that Giants and Nords evolved from an ancient race of Atmorans that combined the strength and size of Giants with the intelligence and ruthlessness of the Nords.
