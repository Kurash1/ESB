To die in glorious battle would be most pleasing to Malacath. To die as your folk do - frail and old - is a disgrace. I have lived many long years and served my chief well.

'A... a good death...' he manages to whisper between gasps. He lets out a final death rattle and then falls silent.\n\nYou order your men to gather his weapons and respectfully arrange his body on a nearby outcropping of stone. Crows begin to circle overhead.

Not surprisingly, this meadery belongs to the Black-Briar family, already notorious for seeking complete power in the city and beyond. It seems that their chances of doing so will increase markedly, as one half of the city will now work for this enterprise and the other half will taste its products. This, of course, is a matter of concern. But we probably shouldn't worry too much about this enterprise just yet, as long as the taxes are paid. After all, people's love does not depend on the abundance of mead, but on its quality."

Every self-respecting family has its own honey recipe and has carefully preserved it for centuries. However, only a few have managed to mass produce their own mead and only a few have developed their business to the point where they can trade with other cities and even countries. Just one such honey brew has already sent its first shipment to Windhelm under the name of 'Honningbrew Mead'. Let's hope that this is just the beginning of a new era in honey brewing for Whiterun!"

 es_flavour.9.d: "The harsh life on Solstheim Island does not mean that its inhabitants do not need honey and wine for their meals as well. Unfortunately, the remoteness of the island makes importing such drinks expensive, and the lack of heat in summer and huge snowdrifts in winter put an end to the usual winemaking in these parts. Nevertheless, some craftsmen have managed to produce their own beverage. Of course, because of its high strength, it can hardly be called wine, but at least it will warm you up during the cold winter months. In the end, the surplus of this drink can always be sold on the mainland."

Of course, this does not work in every case, but one of our alchemists seems to confirm this saying after all. Years spent in his laboratory experimenting with wine and fire salt finally began to pay off. The alchemist managed to establish the technology for fermenting wine on fire salt, and now he is preparing to open his own winery. Certainly we will have his services at court, but perhaps a glass of fire wine once a day will smooth over these difficulties?"

Every corner of the region produces its own type of wine, and of course, every town believes that its wine is the best. It is all the more surprising that one of the wineries near Skingrad has managed to stand out from its competitors and win if not love, then respect not only in the local area, but also in other cities of Kolovia. We will watch their fate with interest, because perhaps one day it will be their wine that will be served at the court. Let us drink to their success!"

However, from time to time, wars, famines and epidemics overwhelm the temple workers and the dead bodies are left to rot outside the sacred walls.

They accuse Lorkhan of tricking the other Aedra into giving up their divinity. This includes those who would become the Ehlnofey and thus the Aldmer, who now blame Lorkhan directly for their mortality. Today our people remember these events and grieve over the old days."

Despite the notoriety of these Daedra worshippers weaving intrigue within the city walls, it is hard to find even a single young girl without a raven amulet around her neck. It seems we can only hope that the Cult of Nocturnal's followers know how to curb their appetites and not become an even bigger problem in the future."

Of course, Noctyr-a's desires grow with each visit, but the rewards for fulfilling them also become more and more real. Wonder what she will ask for this time? To shelter another of her novices in the palace? Or to erect an entire temple in honor of the Daughter of Twilight? What power can she place in the hands of her chosen one? And how could a mere mortal, though of blue blood, not succumb to such temptation?"

But not her own sacrifice, and not a sacrifice in her name. Such sacrifices are made in honor of the gods, to prove her love to her neighbor. These are the words she tells $MONARCH$ as she puts the ebonite blade into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] limpid palm, and motherly strokes [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head.

Nor did [Root.Consort.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entourage pass by the fountain. People say they saw Noctyr-a and [Root.Consort.GetName] sitting side by side, embracing and talking about something. It is unlikely that Noctyr-a will tell the true reason for her grief, especially since the sadness has long since disappeared from her face, making way for passion and love.

Noctyr-a was standing at the window, rummaging through the folds of the white robe she had found in the checkroom, until she called for a maid. The robe glowed with pearls and was soft inside, as if made of feathers. The maid stood staring at the glitter of the robe in the darkness until Noctyr-a put her hands out in front, presenting it to the maid as a gift. As the maid donned the mantle, the priestess Nocturnal's face remained smiling. And when the poor girl crouched in agony beneath the shining robe, covering her whole body with feathers and her fingernails with scales, Noctyr-a laughed. For the first time in years."

But as soon as the priestess Nocturnal put it on, the skin under the robe began to be covered in feathers and her legs scaled. The palace guards all ran to hear the Noctyr-a weeping in agony. At their sight, the creature that had once been a priestess flapped its wings and flew from the balcony, deafening the city with its inhuman roar.

But [Root.Consort.GetName] as if [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] did not notice this and approached the priestess Nocturnal, unfolding [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] parcel. In it was a white robe. It glowed with pearls and was soft inside, as if made of feathers. Noctyr-a stood staring at the glitter of the robe in the darkness until [Root.Consort.GetName] stretched out [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arms, presenting the robe as a gift.

As soon as Noctyr-a put it on, the skin under the robe began to be covered with feathers and her legs with scales. The palace guards all ran to hear the priestess weeping in agony. But $MONARCH$, who had already fallen from all spells, shoved the guards aside and personally slaughtered the half-woman half-bird. [Root.Consort.GetName] ordered the cooks to prepare a roast of Harpy and serve it to the Nocturnal cult maids who were already ensconced in the palace.

It had not yet begun to dawn, and [Root.Consort.GetName] was already standing outside the $MONARCH$'s chambers, swaying as if in a trance, staring into the void before her and clutching in her hands the robe that the priestess Nocturnal gave her before she left their, already shared, bed. The robe sparkled with pearls and immediately caught $MONARCH$'s eye as soon as [Root.Consort.GetName] entered. Without saying a word, she helped $MONARCHTITLE$ try on the robe, made as if of feathers. A soul-shattering scream shook the castle as the skin beneath the robe began to be covered in feathers, and her legs were covered in scales. All the palace guards fled to the cry of $MONARCH$, sobbing in agony, but were stopped by a firm gesture of [Root.Consort.GetName].

But the power under him was cruel, and one day the Nords raised a rebellion against him, as a result of which he was expelled from Nirn. However, according to the existing prophecy, Alduin will return sooner or later. We already see omens of this everywhere. Perhaps we need to make a sacrifice to Alduin to delay his arrival to at least calm the people?"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.12.a: "We will prepare large sacrifice in his name!"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.12.b: "We are going to calm the public, not waste all our resources."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.12.c: "Let the priests do something with it."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.12.e: "Finally, our lord will return!"
 
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.13.t: "The God of Runes"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.13.d: "Junal personifies our fear of the unknown order. The idea that something that doesn't make you physically stronger is worthless is not new. Therefore, many Nords avoid knowledge of the world around them, especially when it comes to fundamental things. But we must not give in to the temptation of ignorance. We have in our hands the ancient manuscripts, magic and runes, and most importantly, Junal's blessing to dare and comprehend his geometry and his order."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.13.a: "The world can be described with Concentrating Runes!"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.13.b: "Guardian runes will protect our neighbours from Oblivion!"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.13.c: "The one who understands Protective Runs will win every battle!"

 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.14.t: "Servants of the Mauloch"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.14.d: "The followers of Mauloch are going on another campaign against us. Under their banners, not only orcs and goblins stand up, but also some people who had the arrogance enough to deny their ancestors, and the courage to pass all the tests of the Blue God. This horde is sent to the fertile plains, where only a fair fight, as required by the Code of Malacath, will determine the outcome of the campaign. However, now they pass along narrow mountain paths, where we can easily take them by surprise and interrupt. What do we do?"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.14.a: "Ambush them!"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.14.b: "Send assassins to murder the leaders of the horde in the night."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.14.c: "Let's show to Mauloch, that we can also fight with courage!"

 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.15.t: "The Old Knocker"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.15.d: "Orkey is considered an enemy god to the Nords because he tricked them into a bargain that limited their life span to a count of winters. Only Shor's intervention saved the Nords from imminent death. And nevertheless, from year to year, when the wind in winter howls desperately loudly, people huddle around the fire, shivering with cold and fear, because they know that somewhere out there, in the dazzling black veil of a winter blizzard, the one who wishes is hiding. them of eternal oblivion."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.15.a: "Hard times await us ahead."

 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.16.t: "The God-Protector"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.16.d: "Tsun is the ancient god of trials against adversity. He has protected our people since the exodus of the Ehlnofey to Morrowind and has never turned down those in need. On this day, we remember the feat of Tsun, who gave his life for Shor in the heat of battle, thereby preserving the faith and giving hope to all Nords."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.16.a: "Please, Tsun, protect our people!"
 
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.17.t: "The Adversary's Influence"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.17.d: "The Adversary is an equal yet an opposite force to the All-Maker who enjoys tormenting both the All-Maker and his followers. It looks like his influence is starting to grow lately. People see wicked beasts around the villages, and someone witnessed the appearance of the Greedy Man. This causes our people to panic, which, without a doubt, we can use to unite the country and strengthen our power. However, this will also mean that we will be tormented by Adversary."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.17.a: "We can use this to raise taxes!"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.17.b: "Let's better secure our power!"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.17.c: "Recruit more people in the army to fight Adversary's beasts!"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.17.e: "Send your best hunter to find this Greedy Man while we pray to the All-Maker."
 
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.18.t: "Times of Great Need"
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.18.d: "All-Maker is the source of all life and creation. We try to live in harmony with our surroundings, making as small an impact on their environment as possible to maintain contact with them. Because sometimes, in times of great need, the All-Maker helps our people to survive. Right now, our people are in a quandary. The situation is not yet critical, but we can still ask the All-Maker for help or organize a ritual hunt to please him and show him for the gifts he has given to us."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.18.a: "Let's pray to maintain stability."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.18.b: "We shall make our country more prosperous."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.18.c: "Protection is the only thing we need right now."
 es_religious_events_aedric_divines.18.e: "Organise the Ristaag!"
 
 es_religious_events_nature.1.t: "Atakota"
 es_religious_events_nature.1.d: "According to the ancient myth, Atakota is the entity that formed from the conflict of Atak and Kota. Atak is considered to exist within all things and personifies order, stasis, and light, while Kota personifies the concepts of chaos and change. The combination of these two opposing entities allowed the world as we know it to emerge and the balance between chaos and order is extremely important for its preservation. Even though Atakota appeared at the dawn of time, its parts still affect us, directing us towards light or pushing towards darkness. Sometimes it helps our people, interferes with a couple, but we still feel the influence of the two halves of the indivisible whole."  
 es_religious_events_nature.1.a: "Strive for the light of Atak."
 es_religious_events_nature.1.b: "Succumb to chaos of Kota."
 es_religious_events_nature.1.c: "Maintain the balance."
 
 es_religious_events_nature.2.t: "Holy Grove"
 es_religious_events_nature.2.d: "Sacred groves attract magical energy that accumulates in tree trunks over the centuries. Over time, it becomes sufficient for use in the manufacture of weapons, armour, or magical experiments. Right now we have one such grove in mind. However, she is guarded by both powerful spriggates and groups of zealous fanatics. And if we can probably still agree with the latter, then we will have to fight face to face with the Spriggats before letting the lumberjacks go there."
 es_religious_events_nature.2.a: "Mages shall find a source for experiments somewhere else. Do not touch the grove."
 es_religious_events_nature.2.b: "Our army will be unstoppable! Cut the grove right now!"
 
 es_religious_events_nature.3.t: "Werebears"
 es_religious_events_nature.3.d: "One of our villages is suffering from werebear attacks. Several residents have already died in the claws and mouths of these creatures, which walk among everyone during the day, and are transformed into monsters by the light of the moon. Although the local garrison has already caught and hanged a couple of people suspected of witchcraft, the attacks continue. Therefore, local elders are asked to send a regular army to help them. However, at the same time, our military advisers warn that we are likely to intervene in a local conflict between several clans, which will cost us hundreds of lives and is unlikely to bring success."
 es_religious_events_nature.3.a: "We will send our best hunters!"
 es_religious_events_nature.3.b: "Indeed, let's first try to make contact with local clans."
 
 es_religious_events_nature.4.t: "Infertile Soil"
 es_religious_events_nature.4.d: "An abundance of fertile land is extremely important for the prosperity of our people. Therefore, we try to take care of the soil by changing crops and using fertilizers. Unfortunately, these methods are not enough to feed the rapidly growing population, so we regularly begin to develop new territories, turning lifeless wastelands into flourishing fields. Even now, our farmers have decided to expand their lands, but their choice fell on the once desecrated lands, cleansed by fire and sprinkled with salt several centuries ago. That's why some people doubt that the development of these lands is justified."
 es_religious_events_nature.4.a: "We shall turn it into grasslands!"
 es_religious_events_nature.4.b: "This is perfect training grounds for our army!"
 es_religious_events_nature.4.c: "Let's better do not touch it."

 es_religious_events_nature.5.t: "Abandoned Temple"
 es_religious_events_nature.5.d: "Several of our hunters report an ancient abandoned temple they found in the forest. The structure is located in the middle of a swamp, which could once have been a picturesque lake, so we can assume that the temple is dedicated to spirits in general or to some kind of patron in particular. Our life is still in the hands of nature, so many people support the restoration of the temple, although they understand that the spirit in whose honour the sanctuary was erected could have left it long ago. However, others believe that we should dismantle the ruins of the temple because we still do not fully know what was happening within its walls in the name of the noblest goals. If the choice is very difficult, then we can always just create a reservation around the temple and come back to this issue later."
 es_religious_events_nature.5.a: "We will rebuild the temple." 
 es_religious_events_nature.5.b: "Demolish it." 
 es_religious_events_nature.5.c: "Let's organise a reservation there." 
 
 es_religious_events_nature.6.t: "The North Wind"
 es_religious_events_nature.6.d: "Every day the North Wind grows stronger, carrying cold from the distant Atmora. Sudden frosts damaged our crops and left livestock without food. Of course, this is not the first time in our history, and we, already taught by the bitter experience of past years, have sufficient food supplies to hold out until the next harvest. However, the coming uncertainty frightens our people and pushes them to sinful deeds. After all, the temptation is so strong when resources are limited and everyone can justify their actions by caring for their neighbour."
 es_religious_events_nature.6.a: "Hard times await us..."
 
 es_religious_events_nature.7.t: "The Warm Summer"
 es_religious_events_nature.7.d: "Despite all the difficulties that our people faced in the past years, we were able to withstand and survive until the onset of warm days. It looks like the next summer will be very warm and mild, which pleases both our farmers and traders and ordinary residents. Finally, they have the opportunity to enjoy life without thinking at least for a while about all the hardships."

This resistance to change has only grown bigger over the years and now he is seen to be openly opposed to the Church.

 es_akaviri_random_events.2.d: "Not all men are cut out to lead a life of war and it seems the conflict our country is currently in has made some of them realize it. The number of deserters seeking to hide behind the walls of the monasteries is not big but they set a dangerous example. As a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is, however, our duty to protect the monasteries and while we have repeatedly warned them not to accept men like these it seems some still do."

 es_akaviri_random_events.3.d: "A conflict has arisen in one of the more influential monasteries of [Root.GetName] after the death of a monk who came from a very influential family. During his time in robes, he had managed to acquire a rich set of valuable manuscripts among other things. While monks cannot own property as such, the law still allows for a dedicated disciple to inherit these things and be considered like a son to the monk. In this case, a young disciple took care of the monk as he lay at his end. There are, however, others interested, and the monastery itself has argued that they should get the inheritance and would likely be very thankful for support in this matter. The family of the monk have also approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] hoping to inherit not only the manuscripts but also some of the land had have donated to the monastery while their family member was part of it."

 es_akaviri_random_events.4.t: "The Importance of Higher Learning"
 es_akaviri_random_events.4.d: "The monasteries of our [Root.GovernmentName] are famed as centres of learning and art. At each monastic school reside, several scholars, experts within fields such as history, reading, grammar, poetry, music, calligraphy and painting. The monasteries compete to attract the most learned masters and maintain them with great honour and monetary compensation. In return, the scholars pass on their knowledge to their students, which consist of potential monks as well as ambitious nobles. To join the elite, being part of a powerful family is rarely enough – everyone who has a significant role in the running of our country has been educated at one of the most prestigious monastic schools.\n\nWe have been contacted by two of these schools and they are asking for our support. If we choose to offer our patronage, it could be beneficial for the scholarly development of the nation."

While this is far from abnormal, this priest carries a dead snake with its tail firmly lodged down its own throat. He claims to have found it on the steps of a temple, a sign that Satakal will soon swallow the world and begin the cycle anew. Naturally, these claims have been scaring and unsettling our people, though, doing something about it may upset those who believe in his words..."
 es_religious_events_nautical.3.a: "It is the end. Of this priest."
 es_religious_events_nautical.3.b: "We shall wait and see, let him preach."
 es_religious_events_nautical.3.c: "The end is nigh! Satakal lives!"
 es_religious_events_nautical.3.e: "It seems this priest needs some counselling."
 
 es_religious_events_nautical.4.t: "Weapons of Order"
 es_religious_events_nautical.4.d: "Recently, we have been approached by an envoy of the Order of Diagna, an order of exceptionally skilled knights. They have heard of our ruler’s decision to elevate the worship of Diagna, and have come to ally themselves with us. In this pursuit, they offer us their services as a commander of men."
 es_religious_events_nautical.4.a: "You would make an unparalleled war council."
 es_religious_events_nautical.4.b: "None are better suited to lead my armies than you."
 
 es_religious_events_nautical.5.t: "Something in the Air"
 es_religious_events_nautical.5.d: "Maybe it’s the work of supernatural forces, or maybe it’s just a nice night. Whatever the case, the taverns are full, the bards are singing, and even the coldest of hearts seem to be warmed for at least a time. Including your very own. Regrettably, though, the one you love is not here tonight. So, who will you spend it with?"
 es_religious_events_nautical.5.a: "I will spend it with the statue of Morwha, the goddess deserves praise."
 es_religious_events_nautical.5.b: "I will spend it with the people, for I love my subjects."
 es_religious_events_nautical.5.c: "I will spend it in the arms of a mistress."
 es_religious_events_nautical.5.e: "I will grab as many husbands as I have arms, just as Morwha."
 
 es_religious_events_nautical.6.t: "A Blessed Blade"
 es_religious_events_nautical.6.d: "As if struck by divine inspiration, our smiths have been hard at work at their forges. After what seems like days madly at work, they have produced a new, distinctly shaped blade. While not particularly special in its own right, some believe the invention not to be of mortal man, but of Onsi acting through our smiths. The question is, what will we do with these new blades?"
 es_religious_events_nautical.6.a: "Give them to the men. A blade with a story will raise their spirits."
 es_religious_events_nautical.6.b: "Melt them down for their metal. Practicality overlooks."
 es_religious_events_nautical.6.c: "Foreigners are fascinated by curved swords. Sell them abroad."
 es_religious_events_nautical.6.e: "Not special? This blade is like nothing we have!"
 
 es_religious_events_nautical.7.t: "A Measure of Man"
 es_religious_events_nautical.7.d: "Last night, I had a dream I’ll never forget. I stood before Ruptga, Tall Papa himself, the chief god of the pantheon. I attempted to speak, but no sound left my lips. Ruptga said not a word either, instead, he extended his open hand to me, to shake my own. I slid my hand into his, and squeezed, I could tell he wanted to see if I was a firm leader to my people as he was to his own. I looked for his reaction and he..."
 es_religious_events_nautical.7.a: "Nodded."
 es_religious_events_nautical.7.b: "Didn’t respond."
 es_religious_events_nautical.7.c: "Shook his head."
 
 es_religious_events_nautical.8.t: "Somebody Cares"
 es_religious_events_nautical.8.d: "Death is but a fact of life, but one which still calls for mourning. To wish Tu’whacca’s blessing upon someone else is equally a part of daily life. A gesture of respect and care, it is for that reason the adherents of Tu’whacca view burial grounds as equally deserving of their attention as temples themselves. As one, however, the question is, which of our nation’s burial grounds will you attend?"
 es_religious_events_nautical.8.a: "The graves of the common folk."
 es_religious_events_nautical.8.b: "The graves of our sailors and traders."
 es_religious_events_nautical.8.c: "The graves of our soldiers and guards."
 es_religious_events_nautical.8.e: "Tu’whacca’s Throne. Resting place of the Yokudans who sank."
 es_religious_events_nautical.8.f: "The royal tomb."
 
 es_religious_events_nautical.9.t: "Erasure"
 es_religious_events_nautical.9.d: "There are threats everywhere. Beyond our borders, some wish to take from us and subjugate us. Within our borders, those same enemies, subjugated as they may be, almost certainly dream of our downfall! It is time we band together and..."
 es_religious_events_nautical.9.a: "Crush the infidels."

 es_religious_events_nautical.9.e: "Reconcile."
 
 es_religious_events_nautical.10.t: "Aberrant Practices"
 es_religious_events_nautical.10.d: "A group of warriors have recently been a regular topic of conversation among our guards. Swordswomen who practice a style of fighting not seen before. Some of our more senior warriors feel they are undisciplined and disgraceful to the more refined arts of combat they have perfected. Though, as the story of the Ephemeral Feint tells us... maybe there’s something there."
 es_religious_events_nautical.10.a: "Bring them here, I wish to see for myself."
 es_religious_events_nautical.10.b: "Let them fight as they wish."
 es_religious_events_nautical.10.c: "Teach them the proper way to fight!"
 es_religious_events_nautical.10.e: "Host a competition, as my forefathers did."
 
 es_religious_events_nautical.11.t: "Look, a Horse!"
 es_religious_events_nautical.11.d: "Tales abound of a golden stallion running through the countryside. Some dismiss it as but a horse with a rare coat, but a superstitious few believe it to be War Master, the steed of Ebonarm himself. If this horse is real, catching it would directly relate our government to the god of war himself. Though on the other hand... if we should fail, it may draw into question our ruler’s mind."
 es_religious_events_nautical.11.a: "Be rational, that horse certainly doesn’t exist."
 es_religious_events_nautical.11.b: "Send a few men, just to address the rumour."
 es_religious_events_nautical.11.c: "Hire some hunters. Who knows."
 es_religious_events_nautical.11.e: "This horse is our number one priority!"
 es_religious_events_nautical.11.f: "Real or nay, belief in Ebonarm strengthens us."
 
 es_religious_events_akaviri.1.t: "The Sacrifice"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.1.d: "Slaves and prisoners are a common sacrifice to the Dragon gods, but even animals have been considered suitable offerings. The gods are always craving more blood, and our neighbours claim that orphans and illegitimate children appease the gods faster than any other sacrifice."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.1.a: "Try sacrificing animals."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.1.b: "Sacrifice children - as long as they are orphans."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.2.t: "Purification"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.2.d: "'A ritual shall always start with a purification,' the priest says to your heir. 'You become pure by fasting, bathing, and confessing, but you must also make sure to respect the gods. When entering the forest inhabited by a god, remember to drink water from a rock depression as soon as possible after you have entered the forest. The water must be spat on the ground and then you are free to continue into the sacred forest.'"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.2.a: "Remember that, and you will become a great administrator."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.2.b: "Remember that, and you will become a great diplomat."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.2.c: "Remember that, and you will become a great military leader."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.3.t: "Pilgrimages"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.3.d: "Local shrines to various gods and goddesses attract a lot of pilgrims, who need shelter, food and other necessary supplies. To allow them to visit our local shrines would bring us prestige and perhaps some other incomes..."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.3.a: "Encourage pilgrims."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.3.b: "Do nothing."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.4.t: "Hot Embers and Cold Evil"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.4.d: "It is customary that we walk over a bed of glowing embers that represents the fires of the Underworld to ward off evil during the year, but the smell of sizzling feet is not attractive."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.4.a: "Let my heir do it."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.4.b: "Of course, I'll do it!"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.4.c: "Shall we invite our Queen to do it?"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.5.t: "Reciprocity"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.5.d: "Nothing comes for free in this world. While any of the many chiefs in our realm would immediately profess to be our loyal servants if asked we can be sure that loyalty comes with a price. Unless we regularly hold great feasts for the chiefs of our realm and see to it that they are rewarded with gifts for their many services to us, we might well find they lack the motivation to do even the simplest of tasks for us."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.5.a: "Let us hold a lavish feast."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.5.b: "We cannot afford more than a moderate feast."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.5.c: "I can see no need for such extravagance."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.6.t: "Festival of the Sun"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.6.d: "The priests, in charge of monitoring the sun, have proclaimed that the most opportune time to celebrate the Sun festival is almost upon us. The festival which lasts several days typically involves the entire population of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as well as important chiefs from the countryside and some of their minor Gods."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.6.a: "The population of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] will participate."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.6.b: "Call upon all of the important Chiefs of the Empire."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.6.c: "All Chiefs and all Gods must attend the ceremony."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.7.t: "The Celebration"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.7.d: "There is great distress in our lands. People are suffering and many fear for the future. In times like these, the Celebration for the entire state might lighten the minds of our subjects. The sacrifices it entails will also make the Gods more listen to our plights.\nFor this festival our priests are urging that we undertake a slave sacrifice as the plight of our people have been great and they feel a grand ceremony is necessary to placate the gods."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.7.a: "Let us stick with the customary sacrifices."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.7.b: "Slave Sacrifice it is."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.7.c: "We must focus on the here and now."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.8.t: "Conflicts Among Clergy"
 es_religious_events_akaviri.8.d: "The clergy of the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] faith has been unusually uncooperative lately. They fear that we merely profess to be interested in their religion for personal gain and that we are not ready to fully embrace, patronize and spread its teachings. Likewise the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] Clergy have also become more and more irritated at our apparent desire for foreign spiritual guidance."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.8.a: "Support the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] Clergy."
 es_religious_events_akaviri.8.b: "Support the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] followers."

The population of the area are not followers of the true ways and have implored us to handle the catastrophe according to the new traditions of our state.

 es_colonisation_events.1.t: "The First Circumnavigation"
 es_colonisation_events.1.d: "Our fleet set sail to find a route to the rich provinces of Akavir. It took them 239 days to cross the ocean westward after they had reached the Sinistral Sea located near the tip of A'raei. The journey after passing Yokuda was treacherous and when they finally reached the Thousand Islands, the captain wept with joy. The fleet continued to follow the light of the Magnus, have passed the Po Tun Desert until finally reaching the coast of Laromedia, located on the very south-west of the Akavir. However, the fleet was attacked there by several ships, which belonged to Tsaesci. Even though ships managed to escape combat and started to move north, the fleet's captain died from a wound caused by a poisoned arrow. By the end of the 470th day of the voyage, our ships have entered the Black Harbour and were able to restore supplies there for a dangerous run along with the iceberg fields which surround Atmora. The fleet attempted to move westward as far as it could, but the ice was so dense, that they had no other choice, but to head south, until they noticed the lights of the Port Telvannis. Our ships have returned to the Tamriel, though they decided to continue the journey to the south and explore the Sea of Dreams. Merchants report seeing our fleet passing the harbour of Lilmoth a couple of weeks ago, heading to Elsewyer. When our ships will arrive at the port of Mistral we will become the first nation to circumnavigate the Nirn."
 es_colonisation_events.1.a: "We are the first to circumnavigate the Nirn!"

 es_colonisation_events.2.d: "We are not the first to have managed to circumnavigate the Nirn, but it is a great feat and it will be celebrated throughout the land! "

 es_colonisation_events.3.d: "People in the colonies think that the prices of goods are too high. They blame the inflated prices on our tariffs and demand they should be lowered."

 es_colonisation_events.6.d: "A colonel in the army is making a name for himself as a strong proponent of armed resistance against [Root.ColonialParent.GetName]. Besides being a gifted soldier, he seems to be an inspiring and charismatic leader and more and more people seem to listen to his ideas of independence.\n\nShould we brand him a traitor and rebel or might he be the one who can help us throw off the colonial shackles and lead [Root.GetName] towards freedom?"
 es_colonisation_events.6.a: "Promote him to general!"
 es_colonisation_events.6.b: "He must be executed!"
 es_colonisation_events.7.t: "Trouble in [From.GetName]"
 es_colonisation_events.7.d: "A colonel in the [From.GetAdjective] army has been making a name for himself as a strong proponent of armed resistance against [Root.GetName]! Besides being a gifted soldier, he seems to be an inspiring and charismatic leader and more and more people seem to listen to his dangerous ideas of independence.\n\nBut instead of immediately beheading this upstart, the local authorities in [From.GetName] have promoted him to general!"
 es_colonisation_events.7.a: "How dare they?!"
 es_colonisation_events.8.t: "Colonial Rebel Executed"
 es_colonisation_events.8.d: "A colonel in the [From.GetAdjective] army has been making a name for himself as a strong proponent of armed resistance against [Root.GetName]! Besides being a gifted soldier, he seems to be an inspiring and charismatic leader and more and more people seem to listen to his dangerous ideas of independence.\n\nFortunately, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] dealt with the matter swiftly by removing his head. This action, however, seems to have stirred up even more desire for liberty [From.GetName]..."
 es_colonisation_events.8.a: "Perhaps a too swift solution..."
 es_colonisation_events.9.t: "The Burden of War"
 es_colonisation_events.9.d: "Our recent war has left the country exhausted. Perhaps some of this burden should be shared by our colonies?"
 es_colonisation_events.9.a: "Let the colonies pay!"
 es_colonisation_events.9.b: "We will shoulder the burden"
 es_colonisation_events.10.t: "The Burden of War"
 es_colonisation_events.10.d: "The recent war of [From.GetName] has left her exhausted. Since the war involved one of our neighbours, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has now decided that part of the burden should be shouldered by us!"
 es_colonisation_events.10.a: "Intolerable!"
 es_colonisation_events.11.t: "New Government!"
 es_colonisation_events.11.d: "If [Root.GetName] is to win their independence from [Root.ColonialParent.GetName], we must get rid of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and set up a strong and stable government of our own. We should choose carefully, as this decision will shape the future for our young nation."
 es_colonisation_events.11.a: "We need a Monarchy!"
 es_colonisation_events.11.b: "We must be a Republic!"
 es_colonisation_events.12.t: "Treaty of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 es_colonisation_events.12.d: "The War of Independence for [From.GetName] is over. Their rebel forces have been utterly crushed by our victorious army, and they are once again a colony of [Root.GetName]. Should we execute [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] and exact harsh war reparations to cover the damages inflicted during the war? Or should we take a more lenient approach to not stir up more trouble in the New World?"
 es_colonisation_events.12.a: "Off with [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] head!"
 es_colonisation_events.12.b: "Show leniency"
 es_colonisation_events.13.t: "Independence War Fails"
 es_colonisation_events.13.d: "The War of Independence has tragically failed and [Root.GetName] is once more under the boot of [Root.ColonialParent.GetName]. Our short-lived government under [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been dissolved and [Root.Monarch.GetName] sentenced to death. A new governor or viceroy has been sent over from [Root.ColonialParent.Capital.GetCapitalName] to take charge and [Root.ColonialParent.GetName] is demanding harsh war reparations to cover the damages inflicted during the war."

 es_colonisation_events.14.d: "The War of Independence has tragically failed and [Root.GetName] is once more under the boot of [Root.ColonialParent.GetName]. Our short-lived government under [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been dissolved. A new governor or viceroy has been sent over from [Root.ColonialParent.Capital.GetCapitalName] to take charge. Fortunately, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been pardoned and [Root.ColonialParent.GetName] has agreed not to demand any war reparations for the damages inflicted during the war."
 es_colonisation_events.14.a: "I guess we should be thankful..."

 es_reclamations.1.t: "The Reclamations"
 es_reclamations.1.d: "The Temple's support for worship of Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec has been declining for the last decades. After the news about the disappearance of the Tribunes has reached the Mournhold the unity among the priesthood crumbled and turned to dust. A new schism may now burst within the Temple into the open. Rumours claim, that Tribunal loyalists are already being purged or recanted by the members of the so-called 'New Temple', which aims to restore the veneration of Three Good Daedra. This may mark the end of the old order in Morrowind, but only time can show how durable those changes will be."   
 es_reclamations.1.a: "This... cannot be true?"
 
 es_slave_monarchy.0.t: "Successor of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 es_slave_monarchy.0.d: "The death of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has left our country without a ruler. All the important households of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are calling upon their influence to have a say in who their successor is going to be. Depending on who wins our new ruler will have the support of different households and different parts of the country. Only one thing is certain, those that would rather have seen their own group's interests prevailing will not greet our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with joy. Some might even spend the rest of their lives trying to limit his influence."
 es_slave_monarchy.0.a: "We need the support of the [first_ruler_alternative_province.Culture.GetName] households."
 es_slave_monarchy.0.b: "Only the [second_ruler_alternative_province.Culture.GetName] loyalists are of use now."
 es_slave_monarchy.0.c: "The [third_ruler_alternative_province.Culture.GetName] candidate has our support!"
 es_slave_monarchy.0.dd: "The best alternative is one who has no ties to the groups in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]..."
 
 es_pirate_factions.10.t: "Sunken Treasure"
 es_pirate_factions.10.d: "Rumors abound that the location of a sunken ship with treasures has been discovered. Wrecked by a raging hurricane, the lost vessel is said to have taken someone thousand sailors and millions of [sunken_ship_country.GetAdjective] golden coins to its watery grave.\n\nNow that its purported location is widely known it is sure to attract opportunistic salvagers and perhaps even the [sunken_ship_country.GetAdjective] authorities seeking to recover their wealth."
 es_pirate_factions.10.a: "Arrange an ambush for would-be salvagers."
 es_pirate_factions.10.b: "Lower the diving bell. The gold will be ours!"
 es_pirate_factions.12.t: "Division of Plunder"
 es_pirate_factions.12.d: "Our latest prize turned out to be carrying a much more valuable cargo than expected. This fact has not yet been revealed to the crews, who would expect and demand that the additional plunder be added to their share. The captains of the involved ships wish to sequester the money to refit their ships, while the fence’s representative argues that it is best spent on bribing officials in legitimate ports. As an argument breaks out, a drunken crewman stumbles into the room and hears too much."
 es_pirate_factions.12.a: "Divide it evenly amongst the crew."
 es_pirate_factions.12.b: "The fence will take their cut."
 es_pirate_factions.12.c: "The Captain will receive an extra share."
 es_pirate_factions.14.t: "Privateer Defects"
 es_pirate_factions.14.d: "The privateer Captain [Root.defecting_privateer.GetName] has made quite a name for himself in the service of the [privateer_origin_country.GetAdjective] Navy. The payment he has been receiving for his prizes however is much less than the full value of the prizes themselves. Like many savvy privateers, [Root.defecting_privateer.GetName] has realized that he could make a greater profit by turning pirate. As a pirate of [Root.GetName] he will be free to plunder to his heart’s content and keep the spoils he has rightfully stolen."
 es_pirate_factions.14.a: "To profit and plunder!"
 es_pirate_factions.17.t: "Smugglers Struggling"
 es_pirate_factions.17.d: "Even at the best of times there it is difficult to smuggle contraband into foreign ports. These are most certainly not the best of times. Many of our smugglers are returning to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] having had their goods confiscated. Some do not return at all."
 es_pirate_factions.17.a: "Unfortunate."
 es_republic_factions.1.t: "Guilds Push for Mercantilist Reforms"
 es_republic_factions.1.d: "Mercantilist economic theory has become fashionable among influential guild members lately. They are, of course, highly knowledgeable in these matters... and also, coincidentally, likely to benefit from the policies they are backing.\n\nOthers are not as likely to benefit. Powerful traders operating internationally claim that these theories constitute a dead end, and will fight tooth and nail to prevent their adoption. With the support of the guilds, it may be possible, but not without political upheaval."
 es_republic_factions.1.a: "We can't afford to explore dead ends."
 es_republic_factions.1.b: "Mercantilism is the future, whether traders know it or not."
 es_republic_factions.2.t: "Secret Societies in Government"
 es_republic_factions.2.d: "The full extent of a party's activity is only known to members. You have paid little attention to these ideas, considering them paranoid.\n\n'[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], our country is in danger! We cannot speak here.'\nA noble drags you to the side and talks in a whispered voice at the length of who may or may not be part of secret parties within the government of [Root.GetName]. He names other nobles who are equally concerned... so many that his side seems more like a conspiracy than the ones he accuses. Even so, there is no doubt that the aristocrats of [Root.GetName] feel threatened by these possible secret societies, brought into existence."
 es_republic_factions.2.a: "Who cares? Maybe these conspiracies can make politicians agree for once."
 es_republic_factions.2.a.tt: "Leave the possible secret guild influences unaddressed for now."
 es_republic_factions.2.b: "Fine. Let those known to be loyal investigate this."
 es_republic_factions.5.t: "Candidates Vie for Opportunities"
 es_republic_factions.5.d: "We strive to strike a balance between military interests and tradition. We choose our advisors accordingly. Families who know this try to plan and get their representatives into positions of opportunity before they seek to advise the [Root.Monarch.GetName] directly.\n\nA position offering such opportunities recently opened, and now different parties are pressuring us for it. There can be no pleasing everyone, and someone has to be appointed soon."
 es_republic_factions.5.a: "Someone experienced in military matters would be of use."
 es_republic_factions.5.b: "Traditions comes first in [Root.GetName]."
 es_republic_factions.6.t: "Trade between Rivals"
 es_republic_factions.6.d: "We are open to business with everyone... as long as we can control it. What business we can and cannot control is open to debate, and like most questions open to debate, it has become subject to it. Merchants have started trading on friendly terms with one of our rivals, claiming it's necessary despite political disagreements. Aristocrats find this questionable and call for an immediate end to the exchanges."
 es_republic_factions.6.a: "We can afford to cut ties with these swine."
 es_republic_factions.6.b: "We cannot afford to cut ties with these swine."
 es_republic_factions.6.b.tt: "[This.GetName] will gain power in one of the nodes we trade in."
 es_republic_factions.8.t: "Offer from Guilds"
 es_republic_factions.8.d: "The guilds of [Root.GetName] have outmanoeuvred their competitors in the political arena, wresting control over the [Root.GetAdjective] government, but their power is far from uncontested. A power shift now may undo everything the guilds have wisely worked towards. Thus, the guilds want to ensure that this does not happen and they do not lack funds for political donations."
 es_republic_factions.8.a: "Do you not think I recognize a bribe when I see one?"
 es_republic_factions.8.b: "A donation used to fund public projects seems perfectly innocent."
 es_republic_factions.9.t: "Offer from Aristocracy"
 es_republic_factions.9.d: "Aristocrats state in a private conversation after a recent political debate that they start to lose ground. They claim, that if we continue to put the interests of other groups ahead, we will soon find ourselves ruled by confused minds who will abandon everything, that has brought us to greatness. But aristocracy can again make this nation follow a true way... and, of course, they are willing to bring the wealth for its wise ruler."
 es_republic_factions.9.a: "What this country needs least of all is corruption."
 es_republic_factions.9.b: "Of course, Traders may rely on our support."
 es_republic_factions.10.t: "Offer from Military"
 es_republic_factions.10.d: "In many other nations, generals enjoy much greater power than here, while in [Root.GetName] money is what matters, not rank. Nobles, who are lacking neither, are well aware of this. They also claim, that if [Root.GetName] is to flourish, it needs a strong ruler, supported by the military in the restoration of its old glory. The nobility is willing to back such a cause with considerable funds unless its privileges are not going to be restricted in the nearest future."
 es_republic_factions.10.a: "The [Root.GetName] cannot be bought!"
 es_republic_factions.10.b: "Your loyalty is highly appreciated."
 es_republic_factions.11.t: "The Inner Circle"
 es_republic_factions.11.d: "You have tried to maintain relative neutrality as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to merchants, especially since they have somewhat fallen out of favour in [Root.GetName]. You are not a member of any guild, nor would it in the current political climate be appropriate for you to be. Yet that situation may change. The most prominent organisation in the country has offered you membership, even promising to maintain secrecy regarding this as long as needed."
 es_republic_factions.11.a: "Loyalty can't be sworn to anything but the nation."
 es_republic_factions.11.b: "A small secret can be kept."
 es_republic_factions.12.t: "A Beneficial Transaction"
 es_republic_factions.12.d: "In [Root.GetName], business and politics have been irreversibly intertwined since time immemorial. Sometimes, we may be faced with deals that benefit many parties but not the state itself. For example, a good business agreement can improve relations with key aristocrats - that's something we could certainly use. However, if we want to avoid the alienation of these partners, we will have to sacrifice some of our integrity as a representative of the nation."
 es_republic_factions.12.a: "Integrity is worth more in the long run."
 es_republic_factions.12.b: "We cannot be expected to go against our interests for the sake of [Root.GetName]."
 es_republic_factions.13.t: "Thicker Than Water"
 es_republic_factions.13.d: "Generals are far from the most powerful faction in our state at this time, but they still use the same methods to ensure loyalty. A recent request for the hand of $MONARCH$'s daughter from a well-known family of hereditary military men is such an attempt. We know that this will force to steer politics closer to the line of warmongers and weaken other factions, but refusing will make it even more difficult to compel support for planned military reforms."
 es_republic_factions.13.a: "The offer should be declined as politely as possible."
 es_republic_factions.13.b: "We need to maintain close ties to this family."
 
 es_religious_events_occult.1.t: "Wealth and Corruption"
 es_religious_events_occult.1.d: "The Church of $COUNTRY$ is a large landowner and this has brought a great deal of wealth to it. However, some people claim that the Priests are being corrupted by this great wealth. Their opponents argue that the Church needs wealth to carry out its holy mission. The key thing is the Priests does not pay any taxes and if it was forced to give its land away it would move it into the hands of people we can tax."
 es_religious_events_occult.1.a: "We will support the Church Authorities."
 es_religious_events_occult.1.b: "Indeed, some possessions of the Priests may be extra." 
 es_religious_events_occult.2.t: "Great Council"
 es_religious_events_occult.2.d: "The Church has gathered the Great Council, which asks for certain privileges in return for helping fight different heresies that are stalking our land. Though, do we need the help of the Priests in keeping the people in their place?"
 es_religious_events_occult.2.a: "Grant the Privileges!"
 es_religious_events_occult.2.b: "Have they gathered only to beg us?"
 es_religious_events_occult.3.t: "Religious Reforms"
 es_religious_events_occult.3.d: "Our faith is widespread and it can be found in various parts of the world. However, this results in a divergence of some religious practices. That's why one of the Dragon Priests is proposing to reform our rites to bring them in line with other branches of our faith. The idea is bold and can strengthen the Church but at the same time it might weaken our power, as we will have to oppose the unified clergy."
 es_religious_events_occult.3.a: "We shall support the Reform."
 es_religious_events_occult.3.b: "The Priests cannot receive any more power."
 es_religious_events_occult.4.t: "Independence of the Dragon Priests"
 es_religious_events_occult.4.d: "The Church is a powerful institution, that consolidates in own hands both the wealth of $COUNTRY$ and the will of its people. If we continue to ignore the growing influence of the Priests we may soon witness the foundation of a theocratic reign within our nation. However, on the other hand, the control of our citizens by the Church may still be beneficial to us, as no one knows, what ideas would sneak in the head of a merchant or a warrior without the guidance of the Dragon Priests and their Inquisition."
 es_religious_events_occult.4.a: "We need to protect the authority of the Church."
 es_religious_events_occult.4.b: "The clergy should be the branch of our state, not the whole tree."
 es_religious_events_occult.5.t: "The Choice of Candidates"
 es_religious_events_occult.5.d: "To promote and strengthen the Church we can appoint some Priests in our administration. Vice versa, to decrease its influence on the minds of our people we can restrict some clerical positions for loyalists of $MONARCH$. But what would benefit us more these days?"
 es_religious_events_occult.5.a: "The Dragon Priests can help us govern the nation."
 es_religious_events_occult.5.b: "Better to keep an eye on those clerics."
 es_religious_events_occult.6.t: "Religious Influence"
 es_religious_events_occult.6.d: "One of the Dragon Priests has stated that the newly built temple in the capital does not glorify our Great Patrons and Lords, but only worships the exorbitant arrogance of the [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Certainly, these claims are groundless and outrageous, especially because the money to build the temple, which is the subject of the debate, was allocated from the state treasury at the personal disposal of the [Root.GovernmentName]. Perhaps we should in future be more careful in selecting both the targets for our donations and candidates for such high church offices?."
 es_religious_events_occult.6.a: "He must learn his place!"
 es_religious_events_occult.6.b: "We will make a further donation to the church to show our humility."
 es_religious_events_occult.7.t: "Heresy in [es_heretical_province.GetAreaName]!"
 es_religious_events_occult.7.d: "Our newly appointed Priest of [es_heretical_province.GetAreaName] has uncovered a horrifying local heresy. He claims that people there denounce the Dragons and instead praise some Daedric entities! The Church has asked us to help in this time of need as he will require many more resources to root out this heresy which is widespread in the area among high as well as low."
 es_religious_events_occult.7.a: "Heretics must be eradicated!"
 es_religious_events_occult.7.b: "We cannot murder every citizen in [es_heretical_province.GetAreaName]."
 es_religious_events_occult.8.t: "Flourish Monastery of [es_flourish_province.GetName]"
 es_religious_events_occult.8.d: "The Priest of [es_flourish_province.GetAreaName] reports that the local monastery is growing at an unprecedented speed. The clerical estate around near the city of [es_flourish_province.GetCapitalName] has grown so big and are so well kept that it has become the envy of our local administrator. The governor has become entangled in a conflict with the local clergy, over where exactly the demarcation between their lands and those of the [Root.GovernmentName] goes. The time has come for central authorities to step in and settle the dispute. Helping the Priests would undoubtedly secure the gratitude of clergy, but this could also be an opportunity to get hold of more land for the state..."
 es_religious_events_occult.8.a: "Clearly our governor is right!"
 es_religious_events_occult.8.b: "We must listen to the Dragon Priests."

 es_estate_regency_events.1.d: "During the last few months, a faction in our realm has been gaining strength and they see themselves as the leaders that should rule during this regency. Their demands started as gossip; someone whispers that this or that person is not happy with the direction of the nation, another says that the leading faction is not as strong as this other, or that they are not as represented in the regency as they should and so on. Those gossips have continued for weeks and their presence in the court is totally obvious nowadays, to the point that the faction challenging our regent's power is vocal about it. The regent is worried, for obvious reasons, and sees that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own faction's power has been weakened to the point of doubting that it can fight back. It is the moment to make a decision that will change our nation."

The [Root.Consort.Dynasty.GetName] is an old and influential family and their seat in [origin_of_queens_family.GetName] is a jewel of the [Root.GovernmentName]. Of course friendship has to go both ways and [Root.Consort.GetName] will be expected to speak for [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] kin while our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will be expected consider such advice very carefully."

After a full week of hunting, feasting and gossiping with the family, [Root.Consort.GetName]'s cousin is finally preparing to return to [origin_country_of_consort.Capital.GetCapitalName]. She assures us that she has had a wonderful time and it is with a deep bow of gratitude that she says she'll make certain to inform everybody back home about how kind the great [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.Country.GetName] has been to her, and continues to be to her beloved cousin."

At the time little was said about [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] origin or [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] upbringing in [origin_country_of_consort.Capital.GetCapitalName] - to most common folk in [Root.Country.GetName] royals are a breed of their own and they care little for such details. However, rumors bringing these issues to light have recently begun to spread... Some say that the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] has refused to let go of [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] old [origin_country_of_consort.Religion.GetName] faith - while the people may have understood the need for a marriage with foreigners they are less likely to do so when it comes to being ruled by a heretic."

While some cultural exchange was to be expected, particularly considering the popularity of the [Root.Consort.GetTitle], it is with alarm that our administrative advisor reports that a religious shift has been taking place in one of our provinces. It would seem that the influence of our [origin_country_of_consort.GetAdjective] [Root.Consort.GetTitle] trickles down even into our subjects' way of worship, as the words of the [origin_country_of_consort.Religion.GetName] believers have converted a surprising amount of people...\n\nWhen confronted about it, [Root.Consort.GetName] shrugs, arguing that [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] has long since converted to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should know that.

Ever since [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] arrived at court the friction between the two has been obvious and it has only gotten worse since the birth of the [Root.Consort.GetTitle]'s first child. Of course [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] would much rather see [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] own progeny on the throne. For quite some time now [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] has silently been pulling the strings to make it happen, convincing - or bribing - the right people and grooming [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] eldest at the best of [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] abilities. However, it was not until yesterday [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] confronted our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and demanded that it was time for a new heir to be appointed."

 es_consort_events.7.d: "They say that a parent's love for their child is without limits, but it is obvious that for some children love is more limitless than for the other. So it is not surprising that [Root.Consort.GetTitle] is trying to get the best teachers, mentors and is even already trying to arrange a wedding for one of her children, while leaving the others to enjoy their childhood. Now [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] is trying to make [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] favourite child the new heir of [Root.GetName]."
 es_consort_events.7.a: "It's not a bad idea. [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName]'s favorite is exceptionally clever."

Making sure that people as well as the administration of [Root.GetName] adhere to the law, while also updating and adjusting the system to fit the times we live in, is of great interest to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Imagine [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] joy, upon realizing that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] [Root.Consort.GetWifeHusband] share many of these ideas!\n'A conversation with you, dear [Root.Consort.GetName], is as stimulating as any council meeting!', [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] exclaims to the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] one afternoon. [Root.Consort.GetSheHeCap] responds with a smile, also much enjoying bonding with [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] [Root.Monarch.GetWifeHusband] over these matters."
 es_consort_events.8.db: "It's no secret that both [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] has a way with words, and thus with people. They can both make a stranger feel perfectly at ease in their presence, and somehow always manage to be the one making the closing argument in a discussion. Although perhaps not entirely equal in charm, and using different personal strengths, they have grown to enjoy attending social events together, often seen smiling smugly at one another from a distance. What is for certain is that the [Root.GovernmentName] is better off since their union."
 es_consort_events.8.dc: "The first time [Root.Consort.GetName] watched [Root.Monarch.GetName] sparring with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] soldiers in training, [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] was impressed. It's not every noble[Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] that would enjoy the manual labor of actually learning how to wield a weapon of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own. 'But [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is not any [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan]', [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] thought before approaching [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] [Root.Monarch.GetWifeHusband] to compliment [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] skills. [Root.Consort.GetSheHeCap] even mustered the courage to ask [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] opinion on the current military situation of the [Root.GovernmentName]. Intrigued by this mutual interest in the military aspects of [Root.GetName], the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has gained a lot of new ideas for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] army."

 es_consort_events.9.db: "Some say [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a crude [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan]. While [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] certainly has [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] good sides as well, a way with words is not something our ruler is known for. However, observing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] [Root.Consort.GetWifeHusband] in attendance, it seems that the couple has found common ground in this diplomatic shortcoming. There appears to be a mutual feeling of affection growing between the royals, born of their shared awkwardness."
 es_consort_events.9.dc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] never enjoyed being coaxed into physical training as a child. Still anxious whenever someone approaches [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] with an expectation of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] showing any sort of combat prowess, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was delighted to find that [Root.Consort.GetName] appears equally nervous around weapons and talk of bloodshed. Together they have bonded over the finer things in life, leaving the dreary conversations concerning warfare and military strategy to other more interested parties."
 es_consort_events.9.a: "Those two go well together."

 es_consort_events.10.d: "Since the death of [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] spouse, the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] has been growing increasingly comfortable in [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] seat, as both guardian of the young heir as well as royal regent of [Root.GetName]. To the general public, it is clear that the situation is temporary and simply a political necessity while everyone awaits the crowning of little [Root.Heir.GetName] [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName]. Meanwhile, there are rumours of other characters, said to partake in clandestine meetings where they discuss, in their eyes, the honest potential of the young heir... 'Putting that drooling imbecile on the throne would be a threat to the entire realm', one conspirator mutters. ‘The [Root.Consort.GetTitle] is certainly a capable [Root.Consort.GetWomanMan], and a much better option', another argues.\n\nAlthough certainly aware of these cunning forces, the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetHerselfHimself] has yet to take a stand on this highly sensitive issue."

[Root.GetName], however, accommodates more than one faith. Those who adhere to other faiths don't always have kind words for the princes of [Root.GetName], with some using our republican ideals as an excuse to openly challenge the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the state church."
 es_government.2.a: "We must ensure that the faithful know who their friends and enemies are."
 es_government.2.b: "Let us ease the situation by toning down our propaganda."
 es_government.3.t: "Thus always to Tyrants"
 es_government.3.d: "The reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is all but absolute. The Princes have secured power over [Root.GetName] for a long time ahead. Everything points to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] ruling for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire life. The Spymaster, one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] closest advisors, agrees with this assessment. This is a person fiercely loyal to their country, so loyal that they would personally take the life of anyone who threatens the state. In a recent meeting with a few carefully selected people, the Spymaster let it be known that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self is perhaps the biggest threat of all. $SPYMASTER$ can assure that the lifetime rule will be a short one."
 es_government.3.a: "We must act, for the Republican cause."
 es_government.3.b: "The Spymaster may have just committed high treason."
 es_government.4.t: "Successes of the [Root.GovernmentName]"
 es_government.4.d: "The Republican rule has strengthened recently, which we can only interpret as a sign that the republic is the future. The increased trade economy and qualified administration could only have happened to a federation of provinces like ours. By giving up some of the dictatorial control the kings of old insisted on, we have achieved things that would have been impossible for them. Now is the time to show our confidence in these ideas by relinquishing some of our control in favour of freedom."
 es_government.4.a: "This is a testament to [Root.GetName]'s greatness!"
 es_government.4.b: "Republicanism is an idea worth our dedication."
 es_government.5.t: "The Coup"
 es_government.5.d: "[Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] is a person of action. That is why [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] was employed by the administration and how [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] has continued to hold the position as [Root.GetName]'s chief military advisor despite being a well-known supporter of the Monarchist cause. Now, their actions have turned against us. Claiming that the unquestioned strength of the Republicans is ruining [Root.GetName], [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] has rallied others who find their power threatened by the ruling faction behind [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHim] and is attempting to stage a coup and take power. Now it is up to us to take action or to let this happen."
 es_government.5.a: "For the Republic!"
 es_government.5.b: "For the Kingdom!"
 es_government.6.t: "Nobles Organise Support for War"
 es_government.6.d: "We are at war, but not just any war. Our enemy is not only one of the current circumstances, but a hated rival of [Root.GetName]. At times such as this, nobles are eager to lead their armies into battle. While allowing the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to rally other nobles and the common people to war would strengthen combat morale, the Republicans are not fools. They know that the effects of this unity will linger beyond the war and that Monarchists will be reluctant to let go of any power they are granted, even for the best of causes."
 es_government.6.a: "The House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has led our nation to victory before."
 es_government.6.b: "We cannot forsake the republican cause for this."
 es_government.7.t: "Republicans Demand Return to Status Quo"
 es_government.7.d: "The war is over, greatly aided by the efforts of the Monarchists, who are still enjoying popular support from these actions and retaining much of the power granted to them. Republicans who were willing to make concessions to the family during wartime are now demanding a return to how things were before the war. Anything less, they argue, would be tantamount to giving control over the country to whoever leads it into battle, throwing away the representative institutions our nation is so proud of."
 es_government.7.a: "Things must return to how they were."
 es_government.7.b: "They fought our war, let them keep their power."
 es_government.8.t: "Rebuilding the [Root.GovernmentName]"
 es_government.8.d: "The war took its toll on [Root.GetName]. The people fought hard, and while some may feel pride in the scars our republic will carry from this struggle, more have been reminded of the brutality of warfare. The Republicans see a chance to seek support for their cause among those who share these sentiments, arguing that the True Republic need not go to war and has no wish to."
 es_government.8.a: "Let us rebuild these ideals, for the people of [Root.GetName]."
 es_government.8.b: "The Prince of [Root.GetName] could lead us to victory in the future."
 es_government.9.t: "Absolute Power"
 es_government.9.d: "We take pride in our [Root.GovernmentName], in part precisely because it is unprecedented and stands in contrast to the oppression suffered in other nations. However, an increased number of nobles thinks that [Root.GetName] should be gathered by the one ruler with unrestricted power, who will protect the interests of both the people and the state. Of course, granting more power to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can strengthen our nation, but won't this at the same time marks the end of liberty traditions in [Root.GetName]?."
 es_government.9.a: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is the state!"
 es_government.9.b: "We will never voluntary deny our values!"
 
 es_dynastic_events.1.t: "A Beloved Heir dies"
 es_dynastic_events.1.d: "A strange fever has claimed the life of your beloved heir, $HEIR$. As the court sheds its clothes for blacker garments, it strikes you what a frail and transient thing life can be. Just as your thoughts are about to turn to the eternal, a young maid catches your eye..."
 es_dynastic_events.1.a: "In the arms of the Gods, I find solace."
 es_dynastic_events.1.b: "In the arms of the maid, I find solace."
 es_dynastic_events.2.t: "Palace Coup"
 es_dynastic_events.2.d: "'$MONARCH$,' $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ says, $HEIR_ADJ$ sword pointing at you. 'Your rule has brought this nation to the brink of destruction, and shame to our family.' $HEIR_CAP_S_PRONOUN$ looks nervously at $HEIR_ADJ$ co-conspirators. An other-worldly sense of fatigue washes over you. Betrayal in your midst?'"
 es_dynastic_events.2.a: "I feel so old..."
 es_dynastic_events.2.b: "You spoiled little runt!"
 es_dynastic_events.3.t: "Heir Falls ill"
 es_dynastic_events.3.d: "The heir, [Root.Heir.GetName], breathes heavily. $HEIR_CAP_S_PRONOUN$ has been lying in bed for three days now, and reflected in the beads of sweat on $HEIR_ADJ$ forehead is the fear in $HEIR_ADJ$ attendant's eyes for [Root.Heir.GetName]'s life. [Root.Heir.GetName] might not make it through the night unless something is done."
 es_dynastic_events.3.a: "Send for a trained Medicus."
 es_dynastic_events.3.b: "Pray for $HEIR_ADJ$ life."
 es_dynastic_events.4.t: "A Child in The Reeds"
 es_dynastic_events.4.d: "Suddenly something startles the animal and, before you have time to fire, it is long gone. You look around you. The water in the small creek reflects the sunlight of a perfect day, and the reeds wave slowly before a light breeze. Is that laughter? You realize now what had startled the animal. In a cradle, floating among the reeds lies a laughing little boy. Judging by his smile, you'd say that he has never known fear in his life."
 es_dynastic_events.4.a: "Adopt him as your own"
 es_dynastic_events.4.b: "Where did that deer go?"
 es_dynastic_events.5.t: "Hunting Accident"
 es_dynastic_events.5.d: "$HEIR_CAP_ADJ$ body has been draped, by whom you do not know, in a white cloth now stained red by $HEIR_ADJ$ lost vitae. They say $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ was found by $HEIR_ADJ$ horse, in a clearing in the woods. You know the place they speak of. $HEIR_CAP_ADJ$ face is calm, almost serene. You reach out to touch $HEIR_O_PRONOUN$. The terrible reality of the situation dawns on you. The cold you feel is that of death."
 es_dynastic_events.5.a: "Sorrow overtakes you."
 es_dynastic_events.5.b: "Oh well..."
 es_dynastic_events.6.t: "Regent Usurps The Throne"
 es_dynastic_events.6.d: "The $HEIR_DYNASTY$s have been nothing but bad news ever since they ascended to the throne. If you were to ask me, and I think you should, these good times are nothing but a sign, that my regency holds divine favour. With God on my side, I shall, therefore, assume the throne for myself. Good Night, Sweet Prince.'"
 es_dynastic_events.6.a: "It was destined."
 es_dynastic_events.6.b: "To the salt mines, traitor!"
 es_dynastic_events.7.t: "Wedding Bells"
 es_dynastic_events.7.d: "Sire...', again the advisor interrupts you, their furrowed brow telling tall tales of concern and sleepless nights. '... the succession does not secure itself, your majesty...' On they go. This dusty old study, and your advisor's dry voice resonating with boredom and wasted potential, accentuate the brightness of the clear day outside. '...which is why it is of vital importance that...' - Don't they ever stop? 'In nature, you find yourself saying in interruption, 'the first step, leading an animal into the grave, is always procreation.' You're not sure if you believe it, only that there is nothing in their voice to convince you that marriage is preferable to the promise of a clear sky."
 es_dynastic_events.7.a: "Nevermind. Nature always finds its course."
 es_dynastic_events.7.b: "Chess on the veranda?"
 es_dynastic_events.8.t: "A Modest Proposal"
 es_dynastic_events.8.d: "While it is not uncommon among a certain type of young men to wish to remain outside the inevitable bonds of wedlock, the bonds are inevitable nevertheless. Looking out from your eagle's perch, you have spotted prey. The ruler of this foreign country has for a long time been postponing his marriage, and his throne lacks a secure succession. This might be the perfect time to form a dynastic bond between our countries. Should we dispatch an embassy to try to marry one of our dynasty's young girls into this foreign royal house?"
 es_dynastic_events.8.a: "Indeed we shall!"
 es_dynastic_events.8.b: "We have better things to do."
 es_dynastic_events.9.t: "A Rose from a Foreign Land"
 es_dynastic_events.9.d: "The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent you a painting, depicting a young girl in his court. Her eyes are green, her hair is black, and your eyes are drawn to the painting as if to a vacuum. A cunning smile finds its way to your advisor's face. The noise of the room dies down. You do not know how long you stand there looking. She is beautiful."
 es_dynastic_events.9.a: "I must have her!"
 es_dynastic_events.9.b: "What is this foul witchcraft? Begone!"
 es_dynastic_events.10.t: "A Thorn from a Foreign Land"
 es_dynastic_events.10.d: "While the poor quality of the painting might explain away some of it, the fact remains that the look of this girl is far from perfection. The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has offered her hand in marriage, and you are not sure if you should laugh or feel insulted. Then again, there is the succession to consider."
 es_dynastic_events.10.a: "A good $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ woman, I'm sure."
 es_dynastic_events.10.b: "This will not do."
 es_dynastic_events.11.t: "Seeing The Real You"
 es_dynastic_events.11.d: "She turns around. She looks at you. - 'Have you prayed lately, $MONARCH$?' The question underscores the distance between you that, for the past year, has been growing. - 'I think you should. I do. Almost every night.' You laugh. For all her human flaws she is still your wife. She draws closer, the hint of a smile spreading across her face. - 'What are you laughing at, $MONARCH$'?"
 es_dynastic_events.11.a: "I just realized how much you mean to me."
 es_dynastic_events.11.b: "The economy is doing laughably good! Haha!"
 es_dynastic_events.12.t: "Talented and Ambitious Daughter"
 es_dynastic_events.12.d: "The lack of an heir is worrying both the people of [Root.Country.GetName] and your advisors. You have an ambitious and talented daughter who has impressed both diplomats, foreign nobles and your advisors with her wit and cunning. Is it not time to consider her as the heir to the throne?"
 es_dynastic_events.12.a: "She would make an excellent ruler."
 es_dynastic_events.12.b: "I am not dead yet! I can still sire a son or two."
 es_dynastic_events.13.t: "A Political Marriage"
 es_dynastic_events.13.d: "Few marriages in this time are based on romance, passion or even friendship. Most are political, where the parents seek to join together two farms, two dynasties or two kingdoms. Without an heir and a spouse, many have suggested that a marriage between our country and [nameless_neighbor_no_more.GetName] would be adequate, or even necessary."
 es_dynastic_events.13.a: "Send a herald to the monarch and suggest this political marriage between us."
 es_dynastic_events.13.b: "If I am to marry, it will be based on love."
 es_dynastic_events.14.t: "A Political Marriage Offered"
 es_dynastic_events.14.d: "A herald from [From.Country.GetName]'s [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has arrived, suggesting a marriage between them and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 es_dynastic_events.14.a: "Accept it."
 es_dynastic_events.14.b: "Politely decline it."
 es_dynastic_events.15.t: "A Political Marriage - Accepted or Not?"
 es_dynastic_events.15.d: "It was not with abated breath [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] awaited the answer from [From.Country.GetName]'s [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName], but [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands still trembled when the herald delivered the message."

 es_government.10.t: "Council Supports $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$"
 es_government.10.d: "The Council stood united today in their support for $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$, who despite $HEIR_ADJ$ foreign roots is viewed as a worthy successor to the throne of $COUNTRY$. This will strengthen his chance to assume power, should our current $MONARCHTITLE$ pass away."
 es_government.10.a: "$HEIR$ is truly worthy."
 es_government.11.t: "Council Opposes $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$"
 es_government.11.d: "A powerful faction within the Council has made clear their displeasure and dislike for $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$, whom they view as a foreigner that has no understanding of the country $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ wishes to rule. Their campaign has weakened $HEIR_ADJ$ chance to assume power, should our current $MONARCHTITLE$ pass away."
 es_government.11.a: "$HEIR$ must go!"
 es_government.12.t: "Bribing the Council"
 es_government.12.d: "Winning an election is often a matter of knowing what palms to grease. A member of our dynasty is currently the leading candidate to succeed to the throne in a foreign nation, and several powerful nobles from that nation have made it clear that they are willing to further shore up his position if our nation proves to be 'as generous as it is great'."
 es_government.12.a: "Reward their support generously."
 es_government.12.b: "Send them home empty-handed."
 es_government.13.t: "Plot Against $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$"
 es_government.13.d: "A certain faction within the Council have made no secret of their dislike for $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$, and now your spymaster has uncovered that they are plotting the assassination of $HEIR_ADJ$. If they are allowed to attempt, there is a considerable risk that we will be blamed, but arresting them would upset their friends in the Council. How should we proceed?"
 es_government.13.a: "Let the plot unfold unhindered."
 es_government.13.b: "Arrest these plotters!"
 es_government.14.t: "$FROM_ADJ$ Schemers"
 es_government.14.d: "We have discovered that the government of $FROM$ has given tacit support to an assassination plot against our candidate for their throne. This is a grievous insult against our country and must be answered!"
 es_government.14.a: "Fiends!"
 es_government.15.t: "Suspicious Accident"
 es_government.15.d: "Our candidate for the throne of $FROM$ has passed away in what appears to be a hunting accident. Though we suspect the accident was a cunning assassination carried out by backers of a different candidate, we have no proof and all our hard work to place our dynasty on the $FROM_ADJ$ throne is undone."
 es_government.15.a: "Awful!"
 es_government.16.t: "Council Forces Abdication"
 es_government.16.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time may soon come. Wishing to secure the title for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dynasty, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has begun to seek support for selecting one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] progeny as next in line, questioning the choice of the Council. The nobles have not taken kindly to this and are considering forcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to abdicate in favour of the heir they have already chosen for the throne."
 es_government.16.a: "Absolutism must be avoided."
 es_government.16.b: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can't bow so easily to nobles!"
 es_government.17.t: "Overambitious Campaign"
 es_government.17.d: "The aggressive war [Root.Monarch.GetName] has undertaken is not progressing well. This is always a cause for unrest, but particularly so when the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is a foreigner. Over the course of the war, people have started to claim that [Root.GetName] is a peaceful nation and that this foolhardy monarch is bringing it to ruin."
 es_government.17.a: "The war has only begun! Onward!"
 es_government.17.b: "We must try to end the conflict quickly."
 es_government.18.t: "[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] Family Gains Claim on [Root.GetAdjective] Throne"
 es_government.18.d: "Recent power shifts among the foreign relatives of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and clashing inheritance laws have led to an unfortunate situation with the house of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]. A member of the dynasty has now been suggested to be the rightful ruler of not only [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s homeland, but ours as well.\n\nWhether or not this claim will be pushed through war or is merely used to bolster the foreign monarch's status for a domestic power struggle remains to be seen. Regardless, the possibility of being forced into a union in this manner is ominous."
 es_government.18.a: "We elected one of theirs as a show of good faith!"
 es_government.19.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Gains Claim on [From.GetAdjective] Throne"
 es_government.19.d: "Our support for [From.Monarch.GetName], our candidate for the [From.GetAdjective] throne, has yielded us many diplomatic advantages since [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] was elected. Recently, however, it has been suggested that the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family's claims on [From.GetName] reaches beyond this single individual and that [Root.Monarch.GetName] should in fact be considered the ruler of both [Root.GetName] and [From.GetName].\n\n[From.Monarch.GetName] considers [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] sovereign, of course, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] outranks [From.Monarch.GetHerHim] in the dynasty. Surely a [From.Monarch.GetTitle]'s first loyalty must be to family, must it not?"
 es_government.19.a: "An intriguing line of thought..."

 es_extended_regency_events.1.t: "Paranoid or Usurper?"
 es_extended_regency_events.1.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName], after surviving several attempts on his life, began to be increasingly cautious. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] began avoiding social events, state ceremonies, and even meetings of the council governing the country, preferring to issue decrees directly from his chambers. Such blatant behaviour has aroused much suspicion among the courtiers, who fear that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will never leave the throne, having usurped power in the country."
 es_extended_regency_events.1.a: "We need to stop [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 es_extended_regency_events.1.b: "It's not that bad."

 es_extended_regency_events.2.d: "The paranoia surrounding [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] grows by the day and is not only causing more damage to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mental health, but is beginning to affect the Regent's surroundings. Interrogations of members of the Ruling Council have already begun to take place regularly. Searches in the private chambers of noblemen suspected of plotting a coup now take place without warning and court authorisation.  Anyone who dares to openly criticise the policies being pursued will, at best, face a night in solitary confinement and, at worst, a date with the executioner. Sure, the [Root.Monarch.GetName] investigations and subsequent purges have identified many spies and traitors, but how many innocent lives have been affected by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] actions?"
 es_extended_regency_events.2.a: "We must make sure there are no traitors among the national government!"
 es_extended_regency_events.2.b: "Stopping [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] will only bring us more trouble."
 es_extended_regency_events.3.t: "Greed is not a Vice?"
 es_extended_regency_events.3.d: "Gold is a dangerous thing, its beguiling lustre impossible to resist. It lurks in the shadows, drawing the ignorant fools with its doom-laden glow, its gilding as round as two demon's eyes. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is no stranger to this ruinous temptation, using any excuse to fill his own pockets. Meanwhile, our nation is plagued by hunger, devastation and corruption and the population is slowly falling into despair."
 es_extended_regency_events.3.a: "We cannot allow [Root.Monarch.GetName] to destroy our country."
 es_extended_regency_events.3.b: "We all fall into the same sins."
 es_extended_regency_events.4.t: "Golden Bird in the Iron Cage"
 es_extended_regency_events.4.d: "The entire palace knew that [Root.Monarch.GetName] was too used to power, but few could even think that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would go this far to keep it. Our rightful heir, [Root.Heir.GetName], was imprisoned after daring to disobey [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s orders. Rumours that [Root.Heir.GetName] may suffer imprisonment from some unfortunate set of circumstances have already begun to spread across the capital."

 es_extended_regency_events.5.d: "Sometimes hope can be found in the most unexpected places. Since the beginning of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reign, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has shown himself to be an excellent ruler, always aware of the needs of our people. Some even say that our people would be more prosperous if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] remained ruler a little longer...."

Our trusted and closest consort implores us to cut off this cancer from our body and have [Root.Heir.GetName] murdered. There can be no doubt that the consort speaks out of her interest in this matter, [Root.Heir.GetName] is no son of hers but his replacement is very likely to be. Our ministers also speak of [Root.Heir.GetName]'s betrayal, however, and he could pose a very real threat."

 serpent_king_reform_1: "Open up Sumptuary Restrictions"
 serpent_king_reform_1_desc: "Our society has traditionally restricted the use of finer clothing, jewellery or even the amount of stories a house may have to the hereditary nobility. By opening up these perks to anyone who performs well on the field of battle we can create a state where every member of our society is ready to do their part in times of war."
 serpent_king_reform_2: "Extend Merchant Obligations"
 serpent_king_reform_2_desc: "The trade guilds have often come to act as our emissaries, diplomats and spies in relations with other countries. Let us formalize this relationship into a set of strict obligations to more efficiently handle our foreign relations."
 serpent_king_reform_3: "Warrior Ranks"
 serpent_king_reform_3_desc: "By creating a system of ranks dependent on how many captives a warrior has taken during his career we can encourage each warrior in our armies to strive towards constantly improving his skills."

 kamal_reform_1_desc: "While our subject peoples have always supplied troops for our armies they have done so to varying degrees. By formalizing the need for every subjugated area to supply soldiers to the central state we will be able to tap the manpower resources of our lands in a much more efficient manner."
 kamal_reform_2: "Expanded Resettlement Policy"
 kamal_reform_2_desc: "The policy of moving entire villages from loyal areas into newly conquered land or the frontier has helped expand the state. This type of forced resettlement could also be used to resettle the population of newly conquered areas into the core parts of the empire. Strict laws should be put in place to forbid people from returning to their original homes."
 kamal_reform_3: "Reform the Cult of Sun"
 kamal_reform_3_desc: "While the Sun is the foremost of all gods most of the peoples in our nation also worship a variety of other minor deities. We must require all corners of our empire to acknowledge the Sun as their main god and that all other idols are given to be kept by our ruler as Sun's foremost representative."
 kamal_reform_4: "State Lords"
 kamal_reform_4_desc: "By moving away from the hereditary or local powerholders as the commanders of our armies we can instead promote a new class of leaders appointed directly by the state. Selected for their merit and loyalty this will ensure that our armies are always led by the fiercest supporters of our state."
 kamal_reform_5: "Reform the Bureaucracy"

A unified army structure would ensure that fewer resources are wasted."
 tang_mo_reform_2: "Central Arbitration"
 tang_mo_reform_2_desc: "While they are unified under our rule, the city-states of our empire frequently get into conflict with each other over everything from trade rights to border demarcation. By creating a central arbitration authority we can greatly reduce these tensions."
 tang_mo_reform_3: "Central Armories"
 tang_mo_reform_3_desc: "In times of war it has been customary for the city-states of Thousand Islands to arm the commoners to raise armies big enough to challenge their neighbours or the Ice Demons. As each state has its armouries the type and quality of arms can vary a lot within the empire. By creating a central system of armouries from which all armies are equipped we can drastically increase the quality of our armed forces."

Some of them cannot help but notice, they claim, that our neighbor has an abundance of materials that would be useful in equipping a modern navy.

They do not have loyalty to anyone, and instead take up contracts in hopes of gaining something they desire. So it is not surprising that these mighty warriors came to our lands as well. The leader of the Havocrel offers us his services on the battlefield for a modest fee and permission to stay on the battlefield a little longer than permitted. Our generals are not very enthusiastic about using these giants in battle because of their effect on ordinary soldiers, but nevertheless they agree that even a few Havocrel can turn the tide of battle in our favor."

Of course, the city guard of [es_baan_dar_province_event_target.GetName] is already looking for a possible informer in the local branch of the Merchants Guild, but while there is no word from them, rumours have already begun to spread in the city, fuelled by some clerics, that this is all the work of Baan Dar, the man with Thousand Faces and patron saint of bandits.

Our hunters have managed to ravage several Ogre lairs, putting them on the run and forcing them to leave the borders of the province. Of course, this means that we won't be able to get any more Ogre Teeth in the surrounding area, but it also means that the people of [ogres_province_event_target.GetName] can finally sleep peacefully at night."

 es_flavour_race_events.8.d: "Lamias are a type of amphibious beastfolk. They have a serpentine appearance: a woman's torso and a snake's tail. Lamias can be found all over Tamriel, and can live both in water and on land, though they rarely stray far from water, and they have been known to settle in abandoned ruins. Lamias seem to have settled in our ruins around [lamias_province_event_target.GetName], which have been badly damaged during the recent battles. Although revered as monsters, the Lamias are an intelligent species; they can speak the Tamrielic language, can use powerful magic, and adorn themselves with jewels. Therefore, we hope that the locals will be prudent and stay away from Lamias' nests, and that the Lamias will not attack those who do not threaten their eggs, so we will be able to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. It is likely, though, that many of the [lamias_province_event_target.GetName] residents will simply decide to leave their homes and go to new, safer places."

 es_parliament_events.1.t: "City Demands Seat in [Root.GetParliamentName]"
 es_parliament_events.1.d: "The city of [es_demand_seat_event_target.GetName] has grown rich and prosperous. They now want a seat in our High Council to ensure that the power that they grant to the government is spared with the most effective and is not going to violate the rights of people, who live and work in [es_demand_seat_event_target.GetName]. If their request is refused, it is likely that many influential merchants and traders will decide to go elsewhere, where it is easier to realise their political ambitions."
 es_parliament_events.1.a: "Grant it!"
 es_parliament_events.1.b: "Refuse it!"
 es_parliament_events.2.t: "Depopulation of [es_rotten_seat_event_target.GetName]"
 es_parliament_events.2.d: "Due to its seat in [Root.GetParliamentName], [es_rotten_seat_event_target.GetName] can boast that it has quite some influence on the politics of our country. That seat is, however, the only thing that distinguishes the area from much richer parts of our state, such as the province of [es_potential_seat_event_target.GetName], which looks on at [es_rotten_seat_event_target.GetName] with great envy. This is something that the local elders have come to realize, and through a combination of bribes and threats, the votes of [es_rotten_seat_event_target.GetName] have come to be controlled entirely by a few corrupt yet influential individuals."
 es_parliament_events.2.a: "Too bad the seats in [Root.GetParliamentName] are untouchable."
 es_parliament_events.2.b: "We must reassign the seat, regardless of the consequences!"
 es_parliament_events.3.t: "Corruption of Vote"
 es_parliament_events.3.d: "The representatives of the depopulated city of [es_rotten_seat_vote_event_target.GetName] have chosen to oppose our proposal in [Root.Country.GetParliamentName]. It seems the elders who controls the area has been persuaded that the issue is not in his best interest."
 es_parliament_events.3.a: "What a shame!"
 es_parliament_events.3.b: "We must bribe the elders then."
 es_parliament_events.4.t: "[es_uni_yes_event_target.GetName] Changes Stance in Debate!"
 es_parliament_events.4.d: "The influential Mages College of [es_uni_yes_event_target.GetCapitalName] has managed to sway a Member of [Root.GetParliamentName] to come out in favor of the current issue if the college receives additional funding. Of course, it could be seen as a bribe, but it could also be a donation. Indeed, conducting so much research and experimentation cannot be cheap, and a little financial support from magicians may well help us in the future. "

 es_parliament_events.6.d: "It seems the people of [es_random_yes_event_target.GetName] have realized how beneficial the currently debated issue would be to them. They have already organised several meetings with representatives of the [Root.GetParliamentName] to discuss what steps are required of them to tip the scales in the right direction and they have, it must be admitted, succeeded in convincing their representatives to support the position of the $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. Let us hope that the rest of the [Root.GetParliamentName] members will follow suit."

 es_parliament_events.7.a: "Great!"
 es_parliament_events.8.t: "[es_random_no_event_target.GetName] Changes Stance in Debate!"
 es_parliament_events.8.d: "It seems the elders of the seat of [es_random_no_event_target.GetName], staunch supporters of our cause just a little while ago, have come to change their opinion of the currently debated issue entirely. It is quite possible that someone simply offered the [es_random_no_event_target.GetName] representatives in the [Root.GetParliamentName] a modest fee for more time to think about their position on the current issue. Although this is only a guess, the current political realities do not change much and we can no longer count on the support of the [es_random_no_event_target.GetName] in the current debate."

We expected nothing less from these schemers, ready to trade the common good for their own personal gain. Let us hope that such actions will not encourage other members of the [Root.GetParliamentName] to change their position not in our favour."

 es_flavour_race_events.20.d: "According to the rumors, a dragon was noticed near the city of [es_dragon_province_event_target.GetName]. It was as big as the mountain, black as night, and flew right over the barrows. Of course, at first it seams, that the people who reported the deadly creature were either drunk or insane, but what if those are not the fantasies of the crazy minds, but true reports? If so, the Dragon might kill everyone in [es_dragon_province_event_target.GetName] and in many other villages in proximity. We must do something to ensure the afety of our people."

 es_flavour_race_events.21.d: "Several fishing boats with half-filled fish holds arrived in the port of the city [es_maormer_province_event_target.GetName].  No one expected them to return so soon, especially since there were no storm clouds on the horizon. Nevertheless, it turned out that the reason the fishermen decided to gather their catch as soon as possible and return to safe harbor was far worse than a simple storm. Several Maormer ships from as far away as Pyandonea were spotted at sea. It is hard to say now whether the fishermen saw the fleet scouts, a few stragglers, or whether they were lucky enough to sail away just before the armada appeared, heading right now toward our shores to begin plundering the coastal settlements. Nevertheless, every minute now counts. If we are facing the threat of another raid, we should send our ships to intercept the enemy fleet as quickly as possible, but if this alarm is false, wandering ships hunting for what is not there can only harm our shipping and international trade."
