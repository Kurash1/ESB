 archeologyscience.1.d: "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], today a messenger arrived at our court, that told us that a redguard researcher and a group of stargazers discovered an old ruin in the province of T'orkum a few days ago. It seems that the buried ruin is called Kardala among the native population. What should we do now?"
 archeologyscience.1.a: "This man could be helpful."

A man from Daggerfall, called Arkan, translated them into a common language. In the story, Baan Dar is said, to help younger people that had to live on the streets like him. He taught them and advised them to do the same as he did. This story became very popular among the Khajiit and Bosmer, who even started to worship Baan Dar as a god of Bandits and a Patron of thieves and beggars."

The book describes the dangers of reading an Elder Scroll. Most people will be blinded immediately, but will also gain knowledge about the Mundus in return. Only a small group called the Cult of the Ancestor Moth can retain most of their sense of sight, but even they will eventually blind, after reading enough Elder Scrolls."

This theory orders the different kinds of Faeries in a Chain, based on similar features and propensities for Magicka. The elves are considered part of this Chain and seem to be connected with the pixies. The theory seemed to have upset a wide part of the population and it might be wise to ban this new paper."

 # Set Caravan Policy Event/Menu
 es_caravans.1.t: "Set Wandering Caravan Policy"
 es_caravans.1.d: "Like most places, [Root.GetName] sometimes finds itself host to wandering caravans of migrant merchants. On the one hand, the unique wares acquired along their long and varied trade routes are highly desirable, and a well-struck deal can leave everybody happy. On the other hand, though, their arrival is often met with some apprehension by the locals due to their reputation as thieves, scoundrels, and n'er-do-wells, as well as their willingness to deal in certain illicit goods. Whether that reputation is deserved or not, is another story.\n\n§GCaravan Policy can later be changed via 'Set Caravan Policy' Estate Interaction.§!"

 es_caravans.2.t: "Successful Dealings with a Wandering Caravan"
 es_caravans.2.d: "Merchants in [caravan_event_2_province.GetName] have had favourable dealings with a wandering caravan that recently arrived. A steady stream of townsfolk could be seen perusing the exotic wares on display from early morning, until late at night. After several days of hard bargaining, and with wagons full of new goods to trade, the caravan packed up and moved on to their next destination.\n\nAs loyal citizens of the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName], the residents of [caravan_event_2_province.GetName] have remitted a portion of their profits to you as taxes."
 es_caravans.2.o.a: "Fantastic news!"

 # Wandering Trader Accused of Theft
 es_caravans.3.t: "Wandering Trader Accused of Theft"
 es_caravans.3.d: "Two people, a wandering trader and a local shopkeeper from [caravan_event_3_province.GetName], have been brought before you. The shopkeeper accuses the caravanner of stealing a precious necklace - a family heirloom - that had gone missing soon after the caravan's arrival. Truthfully, the trader had the necklace, but they claim that they received it as part of a bargain they struck with another resident in [caravan_event_3_province.GetName].\nWhat should be done about this situation?"
 es_caravans.3.o.a: "Those caravanners are all thieves and scoundrels. I don't believe their story for one second!"
 es_caravans.3.o.a.tt: "The wandering trader will be punished for their thievery."
 es_caravans.3.o.b: "Clearly the shopkeep just has it out for this merchant!"

 es_caravans.3.o.c.tt: "A formal investigation will take place in [caravan_event_3_province.GetName] to ascertain the guilt or innocence of the trader."

 # The Truth Emerges
 es_caravans.4.t: "The Truth Emerges"
 es_caravans.4.d.a: "After an investigation conducted by local officials, the wandering trader accused of theft in [caravan_event_3_province.GetName] has been cleared of all charges. Their version of events - that they were unaware that the necklace had been stolen - was found to be true, and the real culprit has since been tracked down and apprehended."
 es_caravans.4.d.b: "As a result of the investigative efforts of the local officials in [caravan_event_3_province.GetName], the wandering trader was found to be guilty of stealing the precious necklace - just as the shopkeeper initially asserted."
 es_caravans.4.d.c: "In a strange turn of events, the investigation into the purported robbery in [caravan_event_3_province.GetName] revealed that the shopkeeper had been attempting to frame the wandering trader! Supposedly, the shopkeeper organized for an accomplice to pay for some goods at the trader with the necklace, under the assumption that the law would side with them over the trader - an outsider - when the \"stolen\" necklace was found to be in the trader's possession. Such deception and roguishness cannot be tolerated in [Root.GetName], and the shopkeep will be punished accordingly."
 es_caravans.4.o.a: "Who saw that coming?"
 es_caravans.4.o.a.tt: "The shopkeeper is imprisoned, and their belongings seized by the state."
 es_caravans.4.o.b: "I knew it!"

# Atmora
 es_conquest_ATMORA_title: "New Conquest: Atmora"
 es_conquest_ATMORA_desc: "Atmora is primarily known for being the ancient homeland of the Nords of Skyrim. Its people were hardy like the land they lived on, showing particular skill as shipwrights and fishermen. Once a hospitable land of wooded mountains and clear-running rivers, a fierce cold has gripped the continent and transformed the pleasant mountain meadows and seaside havens into frigid, uninhabitable wastes."

# Yokuda
 es_conquest_YOKUDA_title: "New Conquest: Yokuda"
 es_conquest_YOKUDA_desc: "The rocky deserts of Yokuda are the lands where the ancestors of the modern Redguard race first inhabited. The ancient Yokudan civilization rivalled any of its contemporaries - they built great monuments, had a rich literary tradition, and were excellent sailors, warriors, and shipwrights. A caste of expert swordsmen known as Sword-singers led a series of invasions into Hammerfell in the first era. These invasions took place in order to flee persecution by the Yokudan emperor who viewed them as a threat to his power. Modern Hammerfell is still greatly influenced by its Yokudan past in religion, architecture, and many other facets of society.\n\nSomewhere around the turn of the 9th century 1E, a cataclysmic event sank large portions of the continent into the sea, with reports differing on whether the cause was natural, man-made, or some combination of the two."

# Summerset
 es_conquest_SUMMERSET_title: "New Conquest: Summerset"
 es_conquest_SUMMERSET_desc: "The Summerset Isles are the homeland of the Altmer, High Elves in more common speech, who have lived there since their Aldmer ancestors drove out the Sload and Goblin natives many millennia ago. The Altmer are proud to the point of haughtiness and supremely distrustful of outsiders. Frequent raids from nearby Thras and Pyandonea have forced the Altmer to become skilled warriors on land and at sea, in addition to being unrivalled mages and sorcerers. Otherwise, the landscape is largely pleasant and welcoming with gently rolling hills, serene woodlands, and abundant coastlines - a true paradise if ever there was one."

# Pyandonea
 es_conquest_PYANDONEA_title: "New Conquest: Pyandonea"
 es_conquest_PYANDONEA_desc: "Very little is known about the continent of Pyandonea. It is a wild place, covered mostly in tropical rainforests and marshland, with a few plateaued highlands in the centre. Pyandonea means \"The Veil of Mist\", which speaks to both its relative isolation from the rest of the world, and the smothering humidity which cloaks the whole archipelago. The Maormer, elven cousins to the Altmer, are its primary inhabitants; Blue-skinned and fearsome raiders, they frequently sail off to wreak havoc along the idyllic coasts of Summerset."

# High Rock
 es_conquest_HIGH_ROCK_title: "New Conquest: High Rock"
 es_conquest_HIGH_ROCK_desc: "It is said that it was in High Rock that linear time, as we understand it, truly began. It is home to the Adamantine Tower on the isle of Balfiera, the place where the et'Ada held Convention and cast down the God Lorkhan, and where the Ehlnofey decided to remain in Mundus to help maintain its existence.\n\nSince that time, High Rock has been inhabited by many peoples. Its native inhabitants seem to have been Orcs and Goblins, both of which still live there today - although fewer numbered than there once were. Later peoples include the Aldmer who colonized all along Iliac Bay during the Merethic Era, the Nedes who settled within and around those Aldmer lands, and the Bretons, who are a race of half-bloods resulting from the interbreeding of the Aldmer and Nedic peoples.\n\nGeographically, south-west High Rock is characterized by harsh mountain ranges that thrust skywards above the rich farmland in their valleys, and a long coastline that offers many places to put in while plying the waves of Iliac Bay. In the north and east, however, the climate changes dramatically to the arid badlands of Ravenspire, and the snowy peaks of Wrothgar."

# Skyrim
 es_conquest_SKYRIM_title: "New Conquest: Skyrim"
 es_conquest_SKYRIM_desc: "Mountains like teeth, piercing the clouds which shroud their ever-snowed heights; Ice-cold streams that splash and bubble into great rushing rivers, flanked by towering pines; Wind-swept tundra bespeckled with hardy wildflowers; Technicolour hot-springs, and woodlands teeming of the hare and hind. You would be hard-pressed to find a rival for the raw, natural beauty possessed by Skyrim.\n\nUnfortunately, the breathtaking vistas are reserved for those stouts of mind and body. While the southern holds have a generally welcoming climate, the northern half of the province is cold and harsh. Thriving there requires certain hardiness that not all possess. Still, many find their way into this unforgiving land.\n\nThe province is primarily inhabited by Nords, although in the First Era it was also inhabited by the Dwemer, Reachmen, Giants, and any Elves who had not yet been slaughtered in the Nords' genocidal rampaging.\n\nNords are a proud people who first set upon Skyrim's shores after sailing south from Atmora to escape political turmoil (not to mention an encroaching ice-age). After an initially peaceful period with the Elves, escalating events lead to an invasion headed by Ysgramor and his 500 companions which utterly annihilated the Elves.\n\nThe Dwemer, or Dwarves as they are more commonly known, dwelt below ground in cities carved from the living rock. Master craftsmen, their workshops produced technological marvels found nowhere else but in other Dwemer freeholds.\n\nReachmen are natives to the Reach in south-western Skyrim, and deeply detest Nordic dominion. They are related to the Bretons who live on the other side of the Druadach Mountains."

# Morrowind
 es_conquest_MORROWIND_title: "New Conquest: Morrowind"
 es_conquest_MORROWIND_desc: "Nirn is made up of many different lands, all of which have unique flora, fauna, and fascinatingly rich histories. However, none can match the sheer alien nature of Morrowind. One moment you might ride around the edges of a murky swamp in the shade of a forest of giant mushrooms, then seemingly in the next pass over a river of lava while volcanic ash swirls in the air, and then again charge across open grassland with no apparent end. You'll find herds of floating, many-tentacled beasts called Netches, as well as burrowing colonies of Kwama, and even the infernal sky-rats is known as Cliff Racers. All this really only scratches the surface of the other-worldly oddities that Morrowind has to offer.\n\nThe province's earliest inhabitants seem to have been the Dwemer, although no record exists of how they ever came by its shores. The Dwemer preferred to live underground, and built extensive subterranean strongholds. They were easily the most technologically advanced of all societies in Tamriel, with vast forging operations, workshops, observatories, and other such facilities. Their carven halls are guarded to this day by their automata which have survived the ages.\n\nNext came to the yellow-skinned Chimer - religious exiles from Summerset who were persecuted for worshipping Daedra. Their exodus brought many hardships upon them, but by the time they reached Morrowind, they were a stubborn and resilient people. Their worship of the Daedra earned them scorn from their new Dwemer neighbours, ironically echoing the critics they left behind in Summerset.\n\nThe two groups lived side-by-side for centuries, occasionally at peace but usually in some conflict or another. The Chimer originally led simple nomadic lives, but their society eventually split into those who wished to stay true to their spartan way of life, and others who wished to secularize and build a new life for themselves. Thus were the Great Houses born and sundered from their Ashlander roots.\n\nIn 1E 700, a great battle between the Dwemer and the Chimer was joined at the foot of Red Mountain on the island of Vvardenfell. Accounts vary wildly as to the exact happenings, but at the end of it all, the Dwemer ceased to exist, and the Chimer were cursed by Azura with ashen skin - a sign of her disfavour - and became known as the Dunmer. However, they found new gods in the Tribunal comprised of Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil who ruled Morrowind until very recently."

# Hammerfell
 es_conquest_HAMMERFELL_title: "New Conquest: Hammerfell"
 es_conquest_HAMMERFELL_desc: "For centuries, Hammerfell was the sole providence of the Nedes and the Keptu (with some Goblin mixed in for good measure) who built up a home for themselves along the coasts and in the foothills of the Dragon's Teeth mountains. For a time, even the Dwemer established holdings in those same foothills, although they were completely wiped out along with the rest of their race in 1E 700. While the coasts are pleasant enough, and the mountainous regions that rimmed its inland extremities have thriving human communities, the interior of Hammerfell is an uninhabitable desert - save for a handful of settlements that centre on life-giving oases.\n\nEverything changed when the first waves of the Ra Gada crashed upon the shores of Hammerfell, bringing scores of dark-skinned Yokudan warriors who annihilated everyone in their path. The native Nedes, Keptu, and Goblins were all but driven to extinction, and their culture was supplanted by the Yokudan way of life. Over time, the name \"Ra Gada\" became corrupted into \"Redguard\" - the name by which the inhabitants of Hammerfell are now known."

# Cyrodiil
 es_conquest_CYRODIIL_title: "New Conquest: Cyrodiil"
 es_conquest_CYRODIIL_desc: "Cyrodiil is sometimes called The Starry Heart of Nirn for good reason. It primarily occupies central Tamriel, but also thrusts south along the river Niben out to the Topal Bay, and westwards through Colovia to the Golden Coast. Its climate varies wildly, from the wintery slopes of the Jerall Mountains to the rugged Colovian highlands, and from the marshes of Blackwood, to the rolling hills, woods, and farms of the Heartlands.\n\nCyrodiil is now primarily inhabited by the mercantile and imperialist race of men known simply as Imperials, but it was once home to many diverse races including the Ayleid Elves - builders of the White-Gold Tower, Minotaurs who inhabited the woods and highlands to the north-west, and as well Nedic humans - the ancestors of modern imperials. The Ayleids were the first to build a civilization in Cyrodiil, which they used to enslave the human Nedes. After untold years of oppression and torturous labour, the Nedes eventually waged a successful war of independence against the Ayleids, who were, in turn, the victims of genocidal violence. Some say that this slave revolt became the first human empire on Tamriel, although this claim is hotly disputed by the Nords of Skyrim."

# Valenwood
 es_conquest_VALENWOOD_title: "New Conquest: Valenwood"
 es_conquest_VALENWOOD_desc: "Valenwood is located in the furthest south-west extremity of Tamriel, and - as its name suggests - is nearly totally covered in dense forest and jungle. Another describes it as, \"a sea of endless green, a maze of foliage with half-hidden cities growing like blooms from a flower\". Valenwood is inhabited primarily by the Wood Elves, properly called Bosmer, although they also share the thick woodlands Wood Orcs and Imga - a race people who resemble gorillas.\n\nThe Bosmer are a people one with the forest. Legend holds that Y'ffre himself commanded the Bosmer to never harm a living plant and to instead sustain themselves solely with the resources of animals - meat, bones, hide, and sinew - among other things. While these demands complicate life in the forest, most Bosmer hold fast to them because they believe it secures Y'ffre's blessing. Accordingly, it is strictly prohibited to fell any tree in Valenwood, which naturally limits options for building settlements within Valenwood's borders. The Bosmer have solved this issue by using magic to manipulate the trees into living cities - all without harming a single one."

# Elsweyr
 es_conquest_ELSWEYR_title: "New Conquest: Elsweyr"
 es_conquest_ELSWEYR_desc: "Elsweyr is the homeland of the Khajiit - a race who may be distantly related to the elven races, but have cat-like features. Their land is divided into two distinct regions; rocky and arid Anequina to the north, and jungled Pellitine to the south. The Khajiit of Anequina live a tribal and nomadic lifestyle, while the Pellitine Khajiit are settled, with their society built around agriculture and trade. Occasionally, the Anequinan Tribes are united by a warlord who leads them on great raids of their neighbours.\n\nSimilar to the land itself, their night-time sky is divided into the twin realms of Masser and Secunda - Nirn's two moons. These two celestial bodies are of utmost importance to the Khajiit. Beyond holding religious and symbolic meaning, their phases also directly affect the physiology of a newborn Khajiit. For example, an Alfiq (a Khajiit with the appearance of a house cat) is born when Masser is waning, and Secunda is full, while a tiger-like Senche is born when both moons are full. When the two moons are aligned in the night sky, an eclipse occurs and a unique kind of Khajiit known as a Mane is born. Manes are thought to be a reincarnation of the previous Mane, thus only one ever exists at once."

# Black Marsh
 es_conquest_BLACK_MARSH_title: "New Conquest: Black Marsh"
 es_conquest_BLACK_MARSH_desc: "Of all the regions of Tamriel, none are quite so aptly named as Black Marsh. The province is one enormous jungle-covered swamp that occupies the entire southeast corner of Tamriel. Beneath the thick canopy of its jungle ceiling, what little ground there is amidst the fetid waterways is muddy, and choked with vegetation. This impenetrable swamp extends across the south of the province into Cyrodiil's Blackwood region, although the terrain does dry up markedly further to the north as the land transitions into the province of Morrowind.\n\nBlack Marsh's native inhabitants are known as Argonians - humanoid lizard-folk who are uniquely adapted to the hostile conditions presented by their homeland. In particular, their ability to breathe underwater coupled with their natural skill at swimming allows them to use the many waterways that criss-cross Black Marsh as a kind of road network, while their natural immunity to both poison and disease means they are unaffected by many of the ailments which plague (literally) other races who attempt to make a home in the swamp. These other races include the silver-skinned men known as the Kothringi, the Barsaebic Ayleids, and the fox-like Lilmothiit of the southern coast."

# Northern Islands
 es_conquest_NORTHERN_ISLANDS_title: "New Conquest: Northern Islands"
 es_conquest_NORTHERN_ISLANDS_desc: "The Northern Islands are a small collection of islands which bridge the Padomaic Ocean between Tamriel and Akavir. Our information on these islands is perhaps the poorest of all landmasses outside of Tamriel. Nothing is known at all of the people or geography of Cathnoquey and Yneslea, and of Esroniet, we can only say that it is the source of many of Tamriel's spices."

# Kamal
 es_conquest_KAMAL_title: "New Conquest: Kamal"
 es_conquest_KAMAL_desc: "The name Kamal means \"Snow Hell\" in the tongue of its natives, which tells you just about everything you need to know about the region. Kamal is in a permanent state of winter, its mountains and forests ever covered in thick snow and ice. It is inhabited by a race of Snow Demons, perhaps an as-yet-unknown variety of Daedra, who are also called Kamal. The Kamal launch invasions of the Thousand Islands each summer, but have always been repelled by the Tang Mo. In the Second Era, a Kamal king named Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal brought his forces to bear against the nations of Tamriel, but was stopped by the combined forces of the Nords and the Dunmer, as well as an elite unit of Argonian Shellbacks."

# Thousand Islands
 es_conquest_THOUSAND_ISLANDS_title: "New Conquest: Thousand Islands"
 es_conquest_THOUSAND_ISLANDS_desc: "The Thousand Islands are home to Akavir's race of monkey-folk - the Tang Mo. They are simple people who prefer to live peacefully amongst themselves. Unfortunately for them, their neighbours, especially the Kamal, would rather see them subjugated and enslaved, and occasionally launch expeditions to that end. No attempts have thus far been successful. Little is known about their homeland except that it is comprised of countless small islands, and presumably has a tropical climate to which their race is well suited."

# Po Tun
 es_conquest_PO_TUN_title: "New Conquest: Po Tun"
 es_conquest_PO_TUN_desc: "As always with the many regions of Akavir, we know almost nothing about Po Tun. It is inhabited by a race of tiger-like humanoids, not unlike the more familiar Khajiit of Elsweyr, who place great importance on the Dragons which were native to Akavir - even trying to become Dragons themselves through means which are entirely unclear to us. Po Tun is presumed to have either a temperate climate like the Tsaesci homeland or a more tropical climate like that of the Tang Mo homeland - the Thousand Islands."

# Upper Akavir/Tsakara
 es_conquest_AKAVIR_title: "New Conquest: Akavir"
 es_conquest_AKAVIR_desc: "Akavir, for now, remains a land shrouded in mystery. The land seems welcoming enough; most reports tell of open plains, fertile valleys, and forested mountains - hardly anything of particular interest. The people though are another story. In the Third Era, an expeditionary force led by Uriel V was nearly completely wiped out by a combination of harsh weather and the arms of Akavir's native inhabitants - the Tsaesci. Some even attribute the unseasonably poor weather to the efforts of Akaviri spellcasters. Although sometimes described as \"Snake-folk\", it is unconfirmed as to whether or not the Tsaesci actually bear the features of serpents."

# Coldharbour
 es_conquest_COLDHARBOUR_title: "New Conquest: Coldharbour"
 es_conquest_COLDHARBOUR_desc: "Coldharbour is the plane of Oblivion belonging to Molag Bal, the Daedric Prince of Domination, and progenitor of all Vampires. It is characterized by gloomy darkness and an enveloping sense of despair. The whole realm is primarily made of black stone covered in a unique lichen - blue in colour. In fact, everywhere in Coldharbour seems to be hued a certain depressing shade of blue-purple. The landscape is otherwise decorated with the rotting remains of trees and grasses, foul marshlands, and countless ruined structures.\n\nColdharbour is surprisingly well-populated by the living. You can find an entire Ayleid city that was torn straight from Cyrodiil, a small Argonian settlement from the last days of Duskfall, and of course, many fortresses, prisons, and laboratories built for the use of Molag Bal and his minions. Less-savoury residents include the pale-skinned Soul-Shriven, countless Daedra of all kinds, and it is even said that the souls of Vampires come to reside in Coldharbour upon death."

# Deadlands
 es_conquest_DEADLANDS_title: "New Conquest: The Deadlands"
 es_conquest_DEADLANDS_desc: "The Deadlands is the plane of Oblivion belonging to the Prince of Destruction, the Lord of Blood and Flames - Mehrunes Dagon. It is a hellish place; Noxious fumes hang low over the landscape, only temporarily dissipated by scorching hot winds which blow in from across seas of lava, and outcroppings of razor-sharp volcanic glass make travel exceedingly difficult. The environment is generally inhospitable to plant life, as evidenced by the myriad charred remains of trees and grass which are scattered across the terrain. What little can survive in such a place is typically poisonous, ill-tempered, or both! It is said that the Father of Cataclysm has built seven hundred seventy-seven fortresses throughout the Deadlands in order to house his many legions. Steer clear of these if you wish to ever see [Root.Capital.GetName] again!"

Now is the time to celebrate and enjoy the fruits of the harvest, and even visitors to regionName are invited to join the farmers. The taverns offer free drinks all day long, an extravagance before the economy of the coming winter months. Underfed farm hands gorging themselves and then getting sick in the town square are the most common sights of the celebration of Harvest's End. \n Bretons celebrate the Harvest Festival in an attempt to placate Sheor, the Bad Man - the ancient Breton god of crop failure. According to tradition, appeasing the Bad Man will ensure good fortune and a bountiful harvest. Fresh apples and bags of grain are burned on a sacrificial altar in his honour, followed by a feast.

Most all the local warriors, sellswords, and rogues come to the equipment stores and blacksmiths where all weapons are half price.

# Wild Hunt

 wild_hunt: "The Wild Hunt"
 wild_hunt.1.t: "The Wild Hunt"
 wild_hunt.1.d: "Due to the increasing foreign encroachment on Bosmer lands there has been much talk of the Bosmer beginning the Wild Hunt, the events of which are swathed in fear and mystery by all except the oldest Bosmer. Apparently in the old times of the Dawn Era, the time of the Ooze, Bosmer existed in a gaseous form, a vaporous maelstrom of mercurial destruction. The great Y'ffre was able to give form to the Bosmer but also gave them the ability to revert to their primordial form, a cannibalistic orgy consuming everything in its path. We heard of the tales and didn't take them seriously. Now we must accept the consequences of our careless expansion into the ancient forests of Valenwood."
 wild_hunt.1.flight: "We are forced to reconsider our expansion."
 wild_hunt_flight: "Appease Y'ffre"
 desc_wild_hunt_flight: "After witnessing the unsightly roil of the Wild Hunt we must reconsider our expansion and try to mend relations with the Bosmer."
 wild_hunt.1.fight: "This abomination of nature must be stopped!"
 wild_hunt_fight: "Wild West"
 desc_wild_hunt_fight: "We have decided to stand together against the mighty maelstrom despite its ancestral maw chewing through our arms and armour."
 wild_hunt.2.t: "End to the Wild Hunt"
 wild_hunt.2.d: "We have survived the Wild Hunt and live to forge another day. The intense amalgamation of woodland spirits rapidly depleted resources in Valenwood and the surrounding provinces. Many died in the wake of ensuing destruction, and worse, many are left without a home, families, or even history. Some question the efficacy of the hunt and if it was even necessary: the Bosmer most of all. Coming to terms with the dramatically irreversible consequences of their actions the former wood elves drag themselves through decimated landscapes, returning home to their watering holes only to witness the disfigured phantasmagoria staring back."
 wild_hunt.2.end: "Thank the Gods!"
 wild_hunt_end: "Rising from the Ashes"
 desc_wild_hunt_end: "The devastation known as the Wild Hunt is over. Now we may pick up the pieces of our ravaged countryside."
 wild_hunt.3.t: "Consequences of the Wild Hunt"
 wild_hunt.3.d: "The Wild Hunt is ancient magic taught to us by the Great Y’ffre, allowing Bosmer to return to their primordial form: a vaporous seething swirling mass capable of pure destruction. While some Bosmer consider this to be the ultimate weapon, others are beginning to realize the complete consequences of ‘pure’ destruction."
 wild_hunt_backlash: "Landscape Decimated"
 desc_wild_hunt_backlash: "We have summoned the ancients and invoked the Wild Hunt. Now we must deal with the consequences of our unbridled behemoth."
 wild_hunt.3.sac: "We will make a sacrifice to appease Y'ffre."
 wild_hunt.3.ret: "We will fight back."
 wild_hunt_retaliate: "Wild Hunt Retaliation"
 desc_wild_hunt_retaliate: "While the Bosmer is certainly responsible for invoking the Wild Hunt, not all were consulted and some are even outright opposed to unleashing this monstrosity."

 wild_hunt_hide: "Powerless"
 desc_wild_hunt_hide: "We have decided to do nothing but hide in the wake of imminent destruction. We are nothing but cowards, powerless against the consequences of our actions."
 wild_hunt.4.t: "Bosmer Religious Rites"
 wild_hunt.4.d: "Our enemies have felt the unbridled power of the Wild Hunt yet still do not take us, or our gods, seriously. They doubt the power of Y’ffre and claim the Wild Hunt to be simple prestidigitation and campfire songs. They have seen nothing yet."
 wild_hunt_bosmerrites: "Bosmer Rites"
 desc_wild_hunt_bosmerrites: "The Great Y'ffre has granted us a boon."
 wild_hunt.4.stab: "We glorify in the destruction of others."
