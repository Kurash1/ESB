 storihbeg_school_desc: "Storihbeg is the Skinchanger, the canine aspect of the Daedric Prince Hircine in the religion of the Reachmen and Keptu. He comes to hunt with his children, the werebeasts of Nirn, and his howl is capable of freezing your innards."
 uricanbeg_school_desc: "Uricanbeg is the Great Stag, the lustful aspect of Hircine, and comes to mate with hinds or mortals, and also arrives to cull the weak within the herd."
 gulibeg_school_desc: "Gulibeg is the trickster fox, and wielder of the Wand of Bone, confuser of mortal beings. He teaches the clever tricks, and allows them to understand different forms of communication other than speech or writing."
 hrokkibeg_school_desc: "Hrokkibeg is the Mighty Bear, the embodiment of strength and serenity. Do not disturb him, lest you be torn to shreds."
 hagraven_school_desc: "The Hagraven is not an aspect of Hircine, but rather the wicked priests of the Old Gods. They are beings of decay and corruption, hybrids between birds and humans, created through rituals that destroy their humanity for impressive magical power."
 dragon_school_desc: "The Dragon is the Akaviri elemental deity of magic, creator of the other forces in the traditional elemental theology of the Tasesci, the Tang Mo, and the Kamal. The dragon is also a demiurge figure in many traditions(especially the Tsaesci), for as in creating the elements, death and suffering were brought into the world as well, and the destruction each element can bring."
 lizard_school_desc: "In the traditions of the Tsaesci, the Tang Mo, and the Kamal, the Lizard is the leader of the resistance against the tyranny of the Dragon, their foremost, and most rebellious child. They represent innocence, prosperity, and freedom. They have been said to guard the Tsaesci against their enemies the Po Tun, who follow reverently their (claimed by the Tsaesci to be evil) progenitor god the Dragon."
 tortoise_school_desc: "The Tortoise, in the Akaviri elemental tradition, embodies the element of earth and is the most resilient of all the gods. They are, like the gods the Crocodile, the Viper, and the Tuatara, neutral in the cosmic conflict between the Dragon and the Lizard, only seeking to survive the storm and protect their family which includes all turtles and all herbivorous mammalian beings."
 crocodile_school_desc: "The Crocodile, in the Akaviri elemental tradition, is the most destructive and violent of the gods, embodying the element of fire. They remain neutral in the cosmic conflict, though their element is wielded by many from both forces in the legendary war for the fate of all beings. They are patron and protector of most carnivorous mammals, as well as crocodilians."
 viper_school_desc: "In the Akaviri elemental tradition, the Viper embodies the trees and the grasses, as well as the rain that nourishes them. As patron to all plant life(especially carnivorous plants), the Viper cares little about the feuding of gods and mortals and only wants to steal their share of the riches of gods and men silently, before either can notice. As such, the Viper is seen as a patron of thieves and assassins."
 tuatara_school_desc: "The Tuatara is the Akaviri god of the water and the air, and secretly the most powerful of the gods, for their sphere is wider than the earth and fire combined. They are the patron of birds and fish, and it is said that their ultimate choice - in favour of the Dragon or the Lizard - will determine the fate of all beings on Nirn."
 lotus_school_desc: "The Lotus is one of the six aspects of the Hist, and is the primal fertility god, the being who brought all the others into being before the Hist arrived in Tamriel. The Lotus also preaches restraint, and is said to be the master of all desire, being able to control their own emotions and desires perfectly with a perfection of wisdom and will."
 magnolia_school_desc: "The Magnolia is the second aspect of the Hist, created by the Lotus as the first experiment in spreading and growing the Hist. The Magnolia is the embodiment of the beauty of nature, and the first tree said to grow in Argonia at the beginning of the Merethic was a Magnolia tree."
 rose_school_desc: "The Rose is the third aspect of the Hist and embodies love and peace. The Rose is gentle, but not weak - her love for the Argonian people and Black Marsh will send thorns into anyone who threatens the Hist or their people."
 orchid_school_desc: "The Orchid is the master of deception and disease. Formed from Sithis's influence on the Hist, the orchid embodies every form of primal change - from creation to destruction. The deadly Knahaten Flu was said to begin when the Orchid, as the embodiment of the Hist, declared the Kothringi and Lilmothiit unworthy of their life in Black Marsh and unleashed the deadliest plague Tamriel would ever encounter."
 tulip_school_desc: "The Tulip is the builder, embodiment of life's - as the essential element of the Hist - ability to create nonliving things. The Tulip has long feuded with the Lotus, for their creations - living beings versus non-living objects - are fundamentally different from each other in essence and being. However, the Tulip and the Lotus both respect each other, for they each possess something the other can never, ever have."
 carnation_school_desc: "The Carnation is the Hist's aspect of self-experience, and is the opposite of the Lotus in terms of thought. While the Lotus seeks to eliminate all thought and desire, the Carnation embodies experience itself, and is responsible for the traditions of exploring consciousness, and mind-altering drugs, in the lands of Black Marsh."

 es_mehrunes_dagon_cult_1_tt: "§T§ Mehrunes Dagon - Sovereign of Destruction \n §W§ Mehrunes is typically affiliated with bloodshed and betrayal. He is reputed to have an insatiable hunger for destruction of any kind, from simple street violence to the death blows of an empire. The 'Prince of Darkness' will lure any he can to do his bloody will in Tamriel, whether the scheme is petty or grand.

Wherever he goes that place remains changed forever. 'The Razor' altered Cyrodiil forever by ending the imperial Septim Dynasty during the Oblivion Crisis. This loss of leadership simultaneously opened the door for the ambitious Thalmor to arrive in Tamrielic politics.

When someone is cursed for doing misdeeds, Malacath upholds the curse. When a promise is broken, Malacath remembers the breaker. Of the many things, Malacath is known for these are some of his more noble aspects, espoused especially amongst Orsimer culture. Though a harsh god, He may be considered one of the most 'mindful' of societal justices and injustices alike.

Malacath lost this combat utterly, was 'eaten' by Boethiah, then leftover as a pile of 'dung' after the battle. Though likely all symbolic, the transformed 'Malacath' emerged as a Daedra of anguish, battle and defeat. Malacath's plane of Oblivion is known as the Ash Pit. Being a land only of dust, ash and smoke, some might say it is a physical representation of his permanent defeat and transformation. For the Velothi Malacath stands as a symbol of ideological failure and combative defeat - two things Boethiah is not tolerant of and would demand be conquered. \n \n §l§ Shock Damage Received = -0.35 \n Production Efficiency = 0.10"
 es_malacath_cult_3_tt: "§T§ Malacath - Defender of the Betrayed \n §W§ Malacath's lesser-known aspect is the patronage of the spurned and the ostracized. Being both an Aedric and Daedric amalgam, he is kin to neither group and rejected by both. Malacath has no comfortable place in the pantheons of mortals or gods. Where other Daedra may only want champions of renown, skill or obedience, Malacath is familiar with injustice and maltreatment, feeling such was done to Him. Those who have been falsely accused, any who are wronged without cause, political dissidents, social pariahs, banned religious zealots - all may be welcomed by Malacath if they are willing to serve His will.  \n \n §l§ Land Morale = 0.15 \n Trade Efficiency = 0.10"

He is usually affiliated with insanity, sudden danger to the self or outright unpredictability. However, a more studied understanding also reveals mystery and wonder. Sheo is the only Daedra who claims to have mantled all other fifteen Daedra, though it is unsure what the result of this conquest was, or if there are any limits to the Mad God's dream or powers.
