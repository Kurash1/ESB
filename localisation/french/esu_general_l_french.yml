 es_endgame.1.d: "The $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ can now sit quietly on the throne, knowing that no one can oppose [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power. Various rivals have been defeated, insidious adversaries destroyed, and the power over the subjects of the [Root.GovernmentName] has never been stronger than it is now. So $MONARCH$ becomes less and less interested in routine reports about the life of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people, preferring to instead look up every night at the stellar sky, being at the same time seduced by the power of the Gods, who exist somewhere, far beyoung the realm of the mortals, and devastated by the realization that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could never reach their level. Well, both Aedra and Daedra are watching the bored $MONARCHTITLE$ intently, but they do not yet know how to respond to such blatant behavior. Perhaps the $MONARCH$'s next move will allow them to decide [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fate."

 dark_brotherhood_spawn.1.d: "Last night someone raided the warehouses by the trading docks, just after several ships had unloaded and left Bravil Harbour and completely cleaned them out. We had already begun to suspect the Thieves Guild of this crime, but it soon became clear that the attackers had slaughtered all the guards guarding the docks, and killed several other merchants and freighters who had the misfortune to linger there after sunset. This is not the way of the Guild and its representatives have already contacted us and said they were not responsible for the incident, but suggest that it may have been orchestrated by a group of thieves unhappy with the current policy of avoiding casualties and who left the Guild a few months ago. City guards have already launched a search for these men while the bodies of the dead are being taken to the Temple for the last send-off. However, everyone in the city is in a state of terror and overseas merchants are cancelling their visits to Bravil until the perpetrators of this mass murder are found and punished."

 dark_brotherhood_spawn.2.d: "The Morag Tong has existed in Morrowind for centuries, and has always found ways to maintain its grip on the region through its diplomatic skills, backed at the right moment by extremely polite requests, vague threats or the sudden deaths of those who do not heed the voice of reason. In recent years, however, these methods have been failing, as a new player has appeared on the political scene who is no stranger to the use of brute force, and who controls thousands and thousands of lives. This player's name is the Church - a player whose influence grows day by day and who is increasingly able to completely neutralize the oldest Assassin's Guild in Morrowind. With this in mind, the Morag Tong negotiate with the clergy and succeed in securing the Church's tolerance for their existence, but in return, the Assassin's Guild must refuse to worship Mephala, the Patron of the Morag Tong. Now the rank-and-file members of the Guild are faced with a dilemma - whether to accept these terms or leave Morrowind to save their lives. "

 dark_brotherhood_spawn.3.d: "Terrible news comes from a remote village where the locals have discovered a deranged woman performing some sort of ritual over the bodies of her five dead children. This family lived on the outskirts of the settlement and had never attracted the attention of either the neighbours or the guards, who from time to time visited the village to deal with petty crimes, like stealing tomatoes or killing chickens. This distraught woman was able to wound several strong men with her dagger until she was captured. It is assumed that it was with this dagger that she killed her children. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to investigate this incident in more detail, as angry peasants lynched this woman right in the marketplace, while she shouted at the top of her lungs: 'Glory to Sithis'."

 dark_brotherhood_spawn.4.d: "According to rumours, the death of the Night Mother did not affect the Dark Brotherhood. Not only did it not disintegrate, and did not stop the execution of contract killings, but it even managed to increase its centralization, without mercy exterminating those of its supporters and members who disregard the Five Commandments. The only explanation for this is the appearance of a new one, and most likely it happened since representatives of the Dark Brotherhood reported that a 'Listener' is going to visit $CAPITAL_CITY$ and establish a new sanctuary of the Brotherhood there. People say that he is the new leader of the organization, chosen by the Night Mother herself and able to hear her. It sounds somewhat fantastical, but the fact remains that we expect a visit from the highest-ranking member of the Dark Brotherhood shortly."
 dark_brotherhood_spawn.4.a: "It would not be wise to ignore such a visit."
 dark_brotherhood_spawn.4.b: "Let us better stay away from close relations with Dark Brotherhood."
 
 dark_brotherhood_spawn.5.t: "Unknown Letter"
 dark_brotherhood_spawn.5.d: "A strange letter was delivered this morning to the residence of $MONARCH$. The letter has neither the name of the sender nor the name of the addressee, however, it contains instructions for conducting a certain ritual, as a result of which any person can be eliminated. Of course, the price of the issue will be different in each case, but we are most confused by the use of various parts of the human body in this ritual, called the 'Black Sacrament'. Is it possible that a new group of Necromancers has appeared in our area? Or is there something more hidden behind these letters?"
 dark_brotherhood_spawn.5.a: "Let's perform the Black Sacrament and find out who are they!"

 es_isolationism.1.t: "Unknown Technologies"
 es_isolationism.1.d: "While examining abandoned buildings in one of the new provinces, our troops encountered combat vehicles powered by steam. These machines, even abandoned by their creators, were able to kill several dozen of the best warriors before they could be stopped. Further exploration revealed entire factories underground, engaged in the production of unknown yellow metal products. It is obvious that the technological level of the opponents is noticeably superior to ours, and we could further study their heritage. But we should remember that unknown technologies can pose a huge threat both to our people in general and to the country in particular."
 es_isolationism.1.a: "We must embrace those innovations!"
 es_isolationism.1.b: "Just scrap the metal and reforge it."
 es_isolationism.1.c: "Stop any research on them - these technologies are too dangerous."
 
 es_isolationism.2.t: "Mages on the Battlefield"
 es_isolationism.2.d: "On the battlefield, our armies encountered certain magicians who perfectly mastered the spells of the school of destruction. In a few minutes, they were able to exterminate an entire regiment of our soldiers. However, we managed to capture some of them and bring them to Akavir. Now we are faced with the question of what to do with them? Should we study this magic, or should we just eat them for the glory of our lost brothers and sisters?"
 es_isolationism.2.a: "Let's study this foreign magic."
 es_isolationism.2.b: "Those mages shall become perfect slaves."
 es_isolationism.2.c: "We will feast... and the problem will be solved."
 
 es_isolationism.3.t: "The Dragonborn"
 es_isolationism.3.d: "Legends say that one day a warrior will appear, with whom no one can compare. He will be a dragon in the body of a mere mortal and will lead our people. However, the prophecy does not indicate what race the Chosen One will be. It seems that this is now playing a cruel joke with us because in the distant lands a man has appeared who speaks the dragon language and leads whole legions. Our troops are completely demoralized by the mere news of this because they cannot fight the one who will become our defender."
 es_isolationism.3.a: "Bend the knees in front of the Chosen One!"
 es_isolationism.3.b: "Does the legend claim, that the Dragonborn appears only Once?"
 es_isolationism.3.c: "Find a monk, who can speak with Dragons and proclaim him as the Dragonborn!"
 
 es_isolationism.4.t: "The Noble Knights"
 es_isolationism.4.d: "Despite the brilliant victories of our armies, we still cannot fully regain control over the new territories, where rebels appear from time to time. With most of them, there are no problems, because in their essence they are not much different from ordinary robbers. Knights who served the old regime and refused to lay down their arms bring much more problems. They are popular among the people who are easily bribed by brave deeds, honour and valour and follow the knights into battle. A few days ago, we managed to defeat another detachment of rebels and capture their leaders of noble birth. What should we do with them? Kill them and cause another wave of anger, or let them go so they continue to fight our presence?"
 es_isolationism.4.a: "Let's just hire those knights?"
 es_isolationism.4.b: "Liberate them, if they promise to stay away from war."
 es_isolationism.4.c: "Those leaders shall be consumed!"
 
 es_isolationism.5.t: "Raids on Garrisons"
 es_isolationism.5.d: "Usually, well-armed and trained garrisons help to deal with provincial discontent. However, practice shows that they are useless in places convenient for guerrilla warfare. Our fortresses in dense forests and deep swamps turned out to be extremely vulnerable to the action of the locals, who can either deliver lightning strikes, then hide in the thicket, or block supply supplies, dooming the defenders to starvation. Some of our advisers point out that it will be easier and cheaper for us to negotiate with the locals than to continue sending people to certain death. However, the members of the military council believe that possible concessions will only further exacerbate the struggle because the rebels will have a hope to get rid of our yoke."
 es_isolationism.5.a: "We will grant some autonomy to natives."
 es_isolationism.5.b: "Our negotiators shall at least try to stop the guerrilla war on status quo."
 es_isolationism.5.c: "Let's see how those rebels are going to hide in the burned forest!"
 
 es_isolationism.6.t: "Rulers of the Sea"
 es_isolationism.6.d: "We are by far the most powerful army on land. However, other people rule the seas. Sooner or later, our interests will clash and there may be a threat of a new war, which we can lose due to the lack of a large fleet. Therefore, it would be wise to start negotiations with the overlords at sea, if only to secure our trade routes. It is not shameful to moderate your ambitions, if in distress they can be doubly realized."
 es_isolationism.6.a: "We will honour their power."
 es_isolationism.6.b: "Naval negotiations may be beneficial to us."
 es_isolationism.6.c: "If we do not start to build a military fleet now, we will never be able to build it!"
 
 es_isolationism.7.t: "Trade Empire"
 es_isolationism.7.d: "Is it possible to rule Nirn without owning a huge army and hundreds of vassals? Is it possible to subjugate all cities by owning only one of them? It turns out that it is possible - and all thanks to trade. The trading empire knows no borders, and the influence of its hard-hitting coin nullifies all our aspirations to strengthen our power. But this does not mean that we must bow to the face of overseas merchants - we must deal with this challenge as well."
 es_isolationism.7.a: "Why fight what you can lead?"
 es_isolationism.7.b: "The new tariffs will cool the ardour of the overseas upstarts and give way to our merchants."
 es_isolationism.7.c: "Let's see how they are going to influence us through the closed border."
 
 es_isolationism.8.t: "Ancient Rites"
 es_isolationism.8.d: "Our religion is as old as the world. However, there are religions, much more ancient, which originated in a time when there were no elves or humans, and which are still worshipped in the most remote and abandoned corners of Nirn. Our priests flinch with horror when they pronounce the names of the Old Gods aloud, and the parishioners of the temples do the same. Unfortunately, with the growth of our empire, we come to the regions where these beliefs rule and we need to decide how to protect our people from their influence. Otherwise, it can become a spark that will burn our society in the fire of religious conflict from within."
 es_isolationism.8.a: "We shall integrate those religions into our faith."
 es_isolationism.8.b: "If we honour their rites, they will honour hours."
 es_isolationism.8.c: "Purge the heretics, their cities, and their shrines!"

 mf_positive_personality.EVTDESC2: "During one of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s usual extravagant parties, a certain [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] of the neighboring nation of [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.TAG.GetName] was also invited to the banquet. Fortunately for us, the gold that would be typically wasted in such a banquet as this was put to good use, as [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] was very pleased with our lavish display and high quality of food, and the [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] is sure to attend our banquets again in the future... should our relations remain friendly, of course." 
 mf_positive_personality.EVTOPTA2: "Tell [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] [extrav_friendly_neighbor_country.Monarch.GetSheHe] is welcome here."
 
 #Negative personalities
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME1: "Suspected Bastard?"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC1: "Rumors around the court say that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s consort has been unfaithful to him. These rumours are damaging enough to our reputation, but the situation has gotten worse now that a child has been born with questionable origins. Although it is not certain that he is a bastard child, the rumours of our consort have already convinced many that it is so... and, unfortunately, some evidence does indeed line up in support of this rumour. All we can do now is accept the child as our heir or deny him the right of succession."   
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA1: "Tis only court gossip..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB1: "No bastard shall be an heir of mine!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC1: "We can allay their suspicions."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME2: "An Inferior Castle"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC2: "Word has reached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ears regarding our rival's grand castle. Our diplomats report that their castle's impressive size and beauty impress all ambassadors who arrive at its gates. While this has little to do with the actual defences of the castle, it seems that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has become greatly irritated by this news; in fact, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has already begun drafting a new castle."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA2: "This cannot stand!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB2: "A few additions shouldn't hurt..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC2: "Trivial things must be ignored."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTNAME3: "A Lax Military"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTDESC3: "The kind and easygoing nature of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has caused our armies to become soft and lax, and even some of our finest generals are falling into the trap of luxury and indulgence. While this sort of easygoing personality is what allows our soldiers to be fully content and completely loyal to our state, it will bring great harm to our military power and efficiency in battle. Therefore, drastic measures must be taken to whip our armies back into shape."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTA3: "Something must be done!"
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTB3: "It can't be helped..."
 mf_negative_personality.EVTOPTC3: "Surely, we can do much more!"

 #Personality Desc
 desc_jack_of_all_trades_personality: "Jack of all trades, master of none. This ruler dabbles in most spheres of knowledge, enough to rule fairly well, but does not excel in any particular skill. Such a ruler is aware of their limits, and will declare war only when victory is likely."

 desc_renaissance_woman_personality: "This ruler is a Classical Woman. Significantly well-versed and skilled in numerous subjects, a Classical Woman rules extraordinarily well in all aspects and is open to learning new ideas and institutions to add them to his arsenal of expertise." 
 desc_ambitious_personality: "This ruler is Ambitious. Aiming for bigger fish, this ruler will be less likely to bother declaring war against weaker nations and instead target stronger ones.

 desc_chaste_personality: "This ruler is Chaste. Pure and restrained, our ruler is unlikely to fool around in extramarital affairs. Keeping all vows, our ruler has built up good karma and even recognition from the Church for their loyalty at the home and the court."

Their reputation of humility and filial piety is known far and wide, being compared even to the Twenty-four Filial Exemplars."
 desc_crusader_personality: "This ruler is a Crusader. Eager to wage war against heathens, this fanatic ruler also has the military skills to back it up. However, a Crusader will choose to brandish a sword over a Bible, and is thus more likely to violently attack those of other faiths than attempt to convert them."
 desc_bishamonten_personality: "This ruler is known as Bishamonten. The forgotten god of warriors, 'Bishamonten' has been associated with our ruler by both allies and enemies. Knowledgeable in the art of war and fighting in the frontlines, our ruler also values honour above all else and refuses to take advantage of enemies in their time of weakness."
 desc_farr_gifted_personality: "This ruler is endowed with the Farr. In Persian tradition, a ruler is granted the Farr from Gods by ruling justly and fighting valiantly, in effect giving our ruler the divine right to rule and justifying their conquests. Thus, our legitimacy and stability shall benefit much from it."
 desc_peaceful_trader_personality: "This ruler is a Peaceful Trader. Preferring to gain power through skill in trade and coin, a Peaceful Trader is less likely to declare war and has a lacking military as a result. However, other countries are also less likely to declare war on a Peaceful Trader due to the trade benefits they mutually enjoy."
 desc_expert_propagandist_personality: "This ruler is an Expert Propagandist. Skillfully controlling the minds of the public in his favour, our ruler ensures the loyalty of the people. To maintain an image of military might, an Expert Propagandist is eager to declare wars in which victory is guaranteed."
 desc_gregarious_personality: "This ruler is Gregarious. Comfortable in most social situations, this ruler's sociable and pleasant exterior earns the trust of foreign ambassadors, and our ruler always knows how to entertain a crowd. Such a ruler also has the benefit of a larger inner circle in the court."
 desc_sotapanna_personality: "This ruler is an Enlightened. Having seen the Truth, this ruler is considered to have entered the first of the four stages of Enlightenment. Such a reputation means our country will always be in good karma, and a ruler who is on the path to Heaven is also much less likely to engage in any offensive war." 
 desc_spiritual_personality: "This ruler is Spiritual. Wholly, and holy, dedicated to their religion, they are much more likely to tolerate their true faith within their country. As a result, they are much more sceptical of offers of goodwill from those who claim to be religious while straying from the true faith."
 desc_keen_recruiter_personality: "This ruler is a Keen Recruiter. Possessing a sharp eye for detecting talent, such a ruler is much more likely to obtain a skilled leader from the crowd. As a result, a Keen Recruiter will always end up with a general of some skill no matter the draw."
 desc_talented_poet_personality: "This ruler is a Talented Poet. Possessing skills outside of the court, our ruler's prestige is known throughout the land for their splendid way with words. Such a ruler will surely be known in the annals of history for being more than simply a ruler atop a throne."
 desc_logistics_expert_personality: "This ruler is a Logistics Expert. Talented in the art of managing resources and manpower in warfare, this individual ensures the security and efficiency of our army's supply lines, even when our ruler is commanding them far from the field in the comfort of the capital." 
 desc_humble_personality: "This ruler is Humble. While not necessarily an incapable ruler by any means, this ruler feels no shame in stepping back and allowing more experienced and skilled advisors to take care of state matters for them. This humility is seen even by foreign nations, who often receive gifts and praise from our ruler."
 desc_earthwork_expert_personality: "This ruler is an Earthwork Expert. Skilled in all things involving the shaping and development of land, this ruler ensures that construction is both fast and efficient."
 desc_cultured_personality: "This ruler is Cultured. Well-versed in all that is intellectual, this ruler's good manners and refined education has earned the respect and admiration of foreign diplomats and rulers alike."
 desc_crafty_merchant_personality: "This ruler is a Crafty Merchant. The head of the state in name but a gold-seeking merchant at heart, this ruler feels no shame in using their political and military position as the head of state to pursue commercial interests and fill their coffers."
 desc_impartial_personality: "This ruler is Impartial. Willing to lend an ear to even the fiercest of rivals, this ruler is respected by all sides of any argument. Such a ruler finds greater ease in adapting to changes and handling subjects with a just and fair hand while still allowing dissenters to speak their mind."
 desc_puppet_master_personality: "This ruler is a Puppet Master. Skilled in the manipulation and appeasement of subjects, this ruler can extract greater sums of manpower and gold from their vassals without protest from the latter."
 desc_galvanizing_orator_personality: "This ruler is a Galvanizing Orator. Their ability to instil even the laziest and apathetic of commonfolk with fighting spirit is unparalleled. Able to rouse all of our peoples to war with a mere speech, this ruler will not be satisfied if their talents are not put to use."
 desc_reliable_personality: "This ruler is Reliable. Unfailingly willing to answer their allies in times of need, other friendly nations are much more likely to aid this ruler when they are in need as well. As a result, our ruler is held in great esteem in the realm of global diplomacy and politics." 
 desc_defiant_personality: "This ruler is Defiant. Unwilling to surrender even in the face of certain defeat, this ruler can rally all troops and peoples within our nation to stand firm when under siege. With such a stubborn ruler at the helm, our people cannot help but stand alongside them to the very end."
 desc_provacateur_personality: "This ruler is a Provocateur. Talented in the art of stirring trouble and delighting in incensing even the most level-headed of foreign rulers and diplomats, their sharp tongue ensures that this mischief is not wasted, as it makes insults very effective in boosting our power projection."
 desc_populist_personality: "This ruler is a Populist. Placing the issues of the people before all other matters, this ruler is well-liked by the people, and talented officials of all classes flock to their court. This ruler is also more likely to focus on the homefront and the welfare of the people, and refrain from waging needless wars." 
 desc_avowed_pacifist_personality: "This ruler is an Avowed Pacifist. Very vocal in their preaching of peace, this ruler is unlikely to wage war even when there is a casus belli, and even less likely to declare war on weaker states. Because their pacifism is known to all neighbouring states, however, when war is necessary this ruler is less likely to be seen as an aggressor."
 desc_good_caesar_personality: "This ruler is a Good Ruler. Talented and virtuous enough to be comparable to the Five Good Emperors of the Ancient Empires, our country is truly blessed to have such a great ruler."
 desc_prodigy_personality: "This ruler is a Prodigy. Showing extraordinary talent in multiple different fields and great promise from a young age, our state and country are sure to prosper under their rule."
 
 desc_impaler_personality: "This ruler is an Impaler. Taking twisted pleasure in the impalement of both enemies and allies alike, this ruler razes as a pastime. The threat of impalement certainly keeps rebels in check, but it also alienates foreign powers, making diplomacy quite difficult... especially when our ruler can't resist impaling their ambassadors."
 desc_extravagant_personality: "This ruler is Extravagant. Wasteful in spending, an Extravagant ruler builds only the most sumptuous of castles and wears the most expensive garb in the land... even when in debt. However, the habit of showering lavish gifts on foreign rulers and throwing expensive parties for noblemen makes him very likeable among the ruling class."
 desc_easygoing_personality: "This ruler is Easygoing. Lax in domestic and military affairs, our armies will lack discipline, and local officials will have greater autonomy. At the same time, a hands-off approach means that our people are more content and less likely to rebel."
 desc_puritan_personality: "This ruler is Puritan. Morally strict and simple in living, our ruler believes in the purification of the true faith and the Church. Disregarding the more primitive heathens, our ruler instead takes greater issue with Heretics, those deemed to be making the true faith impure."
 desc_seducer_personality: "This ruler is a Seductor. Skilled in appealing to others' emotional needs and desires, he is very effective in gathering information from foreign families in the private, although this negatively affects us in the eyes of the church. (Because this ruler is male, the chances of seducing and hiring women of talent is much higher)"
 desc_seductress_personality: "This ruler is a Seductress. Skilled in appealing to others' emotional needs and desires, she is very effective in gathering information from foreign families in the private, although this negatively affects us in the eyes of the church."
 desc_proud_personality: "This ruler is Proud. Holding themselves in great importance, perhaps much more so than they should, a Proud ruler earns him or herself the disdain of all foreign rulers and diplomats alike. However, such a high image of oneself does have some benefits, as someone so vain may win over the people with exaggerated achievements and gigantic monuments."
 desc_cynical_personality: "This ruler is Cynical. A sceptic of all things, ranging from shady diplomats to their true faith, our ruler is the opposite of a spiritual ruler. However, such a cynical view of the world is also quite helpful in catching acts of foreign espionage."
 desc_trusting_personality: "This ruler is Trusting. While this leaves our nation vulnerable to foreign espionage, our ruler's trusting nature also means more relaxed relations with foreign diplomats, making establishing friendly relations easier with arriving diplomats and, thus, their sovereigns."
 desc_hotheaded_personality: "This ruler is Hotheaded. Always taking up arms at every little perceived offence, this ruler is too stubborn to back down or surrender even in the face of defeat. This trait, while helpful in inspiring our soldiers during wartime, takes quite the hit on our reputation during times of peace."
 desc_reckless_leader_personality: "This ruler is a Reckless Leader. Ordering his men to charge headlong in battle, and sometimes even leading the vanguard themselves, this ruler often quickly depletes our resources through their continual reckless and aggressive campaigns into enemy lands."
 desc_unorthodox_personality: "This ruler is Unorthodox. Habitually going against the orthodox doctrine, this ruler often sympathizes with heretics, sometimes unintentionally. Although claiming to follow the true faith, their actions speak louder than their words... and their actions are saying that this ruler is a heretic."
 desc_ethnocentric_personality: "This ruler is Ethnocentric. While not outright xenophobic, this ruler will promote their own culture and peoples above all else, oftentimes at the expense of other cultural minorities. Such a ruler will attempt to shape others in the mould of their own culture and aim to conquer lands inhabited by cultures aligning with their own." 
 desc_pyromaniac_personality: "This ruler is a Pyromaniac. Taking strange delight in watching things burn, whether they be buildings, farms, or people, this ruler's fiery method of warfare makes conquered peoples much more difficult to pacify after burning down their homes. Fortunately, however, our ruler is sure to secure the gold before setting fire to our enemies' treasury."
 desc_ruthless_personality: "This ruler is Ruthless. Believing wholeheartedly that the ends justify the means, this ruler will do whatever it takes to achieve their goal. Unfortunately, this quality is well known to all foreign rulers, many of whom keep an eye on our ruler for any signs of aggression."
 desc_two_faced_personality: "This ruler is Two-Faced. Excelling at acting kind, albeit insincerely, to diplomats and foreign families, in truth this ruler is a tyrant at the home. Foreign powers may see this ruler as a kind and trustworthy individual, but their people know exactly what kind of ruler they are beneath the facade."
 desc_overly_generous_personality: "This ruler is Overly Generous. While their great magnanimity keeps all of their subjects happy and loyal to the state, their habits of taking these funds directly from the treasury often empty our coffers much faster than their statesmen would prefer."
 
 desc_paranoid_personality: "This ruler is Paranoid. Sleeping with one eye open may catch more cases of treachery, but such a ruler is also more likely of suspecting the innocent and employ less talented advisors. Thus, overestimating the enemy, being wary of diplomatic offers, and preemptive betrayal of otherwise innocent allies are all common among paranoid rulers."
 desc_immature_personality: "This ruler is Immature. Childish and impulsive, our ruler acts crudely at inappropriate times; as a result, none take us seriously. But this is a double-edged sword, however, as they are less likely to acknowledge our expansions a legitimate threat, perhaps out of embarrassment of feeling threatened by a man-child of a ruler." 
 desc_lustful_personality: "This ruler is Lustful. Preoccupied only by sexual desire, this ruler is eager to engage in numerous royal marriages without care for political consequences. Having a poor reputation among the Church, as a result, a Lustful ruler is also more likely to be deceived through seduction by foreign spies."
 desc_unfaithful_personality: "This ruler is Unfaithful. Often breaking promises, including marriage vows, our ruler has built up a poor reputation from betrayal in both the realms of diplomacy and the bedroom. An unfaithful ruler is surrounded by a heavy aura of bad karma, and thus other nations are more likely to view us with caution."
 desc_overbearing_personality: "This ruler is Overbearing. Habitually speaking with a condescending tone, whether purposefully or not, our ruler is likely to offend our subjects by asserting too much authority over them. Our ruler is also less likely to accept offers of alliances from those deemed as lesser powers."
 desc_indecisive_personality: "This ruler is Indecisive. Struggling to reach a decision, our ruler may issue confusing or contradicting orders, slowing down the speed at which our armies mobilize. An indecisive ruler is also more likely to miss golden opportunities and abstain from taking action, or may declare wars coupled with poor timing."
 desc_sadistic_personality: "This ruler is Sadistic. Taking pleasure in watching others suffer, they are much more likely to raze and loot provinces. They also enjoy abusing their subjects and publicly executing traitors of the court in gruesome ways, which lowers subject opinion. At the same time, it may make those of our homeland think twice before rebelling."
 desc_barbaric_personality: "This ruler is Barbaric. The opposite of a civilized man of the court, our ruler's crude actions has earned him the mockery of foreign courts throughout the land. At the same time, our ruler's rowdiness has attracted the company of rough mercenaries, often drinking together late into the night and returning to the court hungover."
 desc_inferiority_complex_personality: "This ruler has an Inferiority Complex. Always perceiving others as greater in military and culture, our ruler will go to unnecessary ends to build the grandest, costliest ships and architecture to prove their worth. Such a ruler will also drag out wars to claim shallow 'merits' in battle."
 desc_xenophobic_personality: "This ruler is Xenophobic. Extremely intolerant towards other cultures, it will be exponentially more difficult to accept any culture other than our own. This ruler is also more likely to employ only those of the same culture and nationality within their inner circle."
 desc_dull_personality: "This ruler is Stupid. Taking little interest in... anything, our ruler is less likely to pick up on new ideas or pay attention to the politics of our court, let alone global politics. Unfortunately for their consort, this insipidness also applies to the private chambers..."
 desc_treacherous_personality: "This ruler is Treacherous. Having no qualms in betraying anyone, even those of the same kin, this ruler will break alliances without hesitation. Although this activity gives us a terrible reputation, it makes it much easier for us to fabricate claims, especially with typical, standard morality being out of the question."
 desc_timid_personality: "This ruler is Timid. Although not necessarily a poor ruler or leader, this ruler will be intimidated by disgruntled citizens, and if tensions rise to the point that rebellion breaks out, this ruler will be unable to handle the pressure and find greater difficulty in suppressing the revolt. This ruler is also more likely to accept offers of peace from their enemies during war."
 desc_kinslayer_personality: "This ruler is a Kinslayer. Paranoid about the legitimacy of their heir and dominion, a Kinslayer will undergo all means to ensure a safe succession for their heir, whether through killing rival family members or by accepting royal marriages to ensure a legitimate heir. For someone who has no qualms with killing kin, killing their rebelling subjects should not be a problem either."
 desc_content_personality: "This ruler is Content. Completely satisfied with the comforts of the capital, this ruler has little to no ambition of expanding the nation beyond its current borders. Such a ruler is much less likely to declare war and, when war is necessary, is often unenthusiastic in making the proper preparations of war, such as producing official documents and conducting espionage."
 desc_delusional_personality: "This ruler is Delusional. Believing themselves to be completely immune to danger, our ruler underestimates the odds of war and is thus more likely to openly declare war with powerful nations. Pushing our armies to unrealistic standards and exhausting our nation's resources, other nations are also less likely to aid us in our ruler's reckless military pursuits."
 desc_envious_personality: "This ruler is Envious. Always coveting the material wealth and prestige of other nations and their ruling class, a nation under this ruler is much harder to establish mutual diplomatic relations with; once an alliance is established, however, this ruler is reluctant to help their allies in any way, and may even betray their allies outright if he feels humiliated by their superior wealth."
 desc_slothful_personality: "This ruler is Slothful. This ruler would rather turn over in his bed and go back to sleep, delaying the dispatch of envoys on important diplomatic matters as well as the construction of key projects. This ruler also prefers to gain land through coercion rather than launch a preemptive strike themselves."
 desc_ignorant_personality: "This ruler is Ignorant. Completely disregarding warnings, customs and knowledge in general, oftentimes willfully, this ruler has a particular talent in offending most people they interact with, and a particular lack of talent when it comes to grasping new ideas and innovations."
 desc_unprincipled_ruffian_personality: "This ruler is an Unprincipled Ruffian. Employing street thugs who answer only to their command, their methods are effective in suppressing feelings of revolt, though only temporarily, as their street gangs are undisciplined and violent enough to start riots on their own."
 desc_senile_personality: "This ruler is Senile. Unfortunately, this ruler's old age has taken a toll on their ability. This makes diplomacy increasingly difficult, as other nations are much less willing to aid a ruler who cannot even handle the affairs of their state without their officials shouldering all of the work."

 es_terrain.1.t: "The Sand Storm"
 es_terrain.1.d: "The terrible sandstorm that broke out in one of our deserts is gaining strength more and more every day. A hurricane wind sweeps the nomad settlements, and in large cities, it falls trees and breaks windows. From everywhere there are reports of injured citizens - wounded and killed. If the situation does not change, then soon the whole region will be buried under a meter layer of sand. It seems we will have to prepare for difficult times."
 es_terrain.1.a: "This is Horrible!"
 
 es_terrain.7.t: "Tropical Storms"
 es_terrain.7.d: "Recently, the number of storms has increased. It is difficult to say what caused this - increased wind, too warm weather in the summer, or the will of the gods. However, more and more ships do not return from distant lands, and local hoaxes suffer losses due to incessant heavy rains."
 es_terrain.7.a: "These are temporary difficulties."
 
 es_terrain.11.t: "The Flood"
 es_terrain.11.d: "Floods have always happened in our lands. From year to year, they damaged the lands of our farmers, took the lives of our citizens and perpetuated them in history thanks to paintings, legends and memorials. But recently, their strength has increased, and now many of our cities are gradually going underwater. Old people say that soon the water will subside, as it did many times. But what if the floods don't stop?"
 es_terrain.11.a: "It's time to fill the bags with sand."

 es_terrain.16.t: "The Ice Age"
 es_terrain.16.d: "Every year, winter comes to our region, turning water and blood to ice. We are used to it and we learn to adapt. However, with each its arrival, winter is becoming stronger and takes away more and more of our strengths and lives. Probably someday we will leave the lifeless lands that were once our home and now turn into ice wastelands. But for now, we will stay here."

 es_orcish_flavour.1.d: "From all over the mountains and hills you can hear the wild howling of the hordes of orcs, whose fury does not know the limit. Soon, their wild flocks will gather together to sow chaos and horror in the expanse of Nirn. Get ready... Not everyone will be able to live to see the sunset of the next day."
 es_orcish_flavour.1.a: "War-ar!"
 es_orcish_flavour.2.t: "Who Will Lead New Campaign?"
 es_orcish_flavour.2.d: "Our brave wars are going to another campaign on the enemy's land for fame and prey. But the successful completion of such an event is unlikely without competent and skilful leadership. Many believe that it is our leader who should take the lead in the united army. But it is necessary to remember that it will put his life, as well as the fate of the ruling clan in jeopardy."
 es_orcish_flavour.2.a: "Luck and glory will be on the Chief's side!"
 es_orcish_flavour.2.b: "We will find someone else."
 es_orcish_flavour.3.t: "The Chief is Captured"
 es_orcish_flavour.3.d: "According to unconfirmed information, our ruler was captured by the enemy when personally leading the soldiers into battle. Despite his strength and the elite soldiers who accompanied him, he was trapped and forced to fight with superior forces without the possibility of retreat. Surprisingly, the ruler let himself be taken prisoner, but that is exactly what the envoy claims. We have time before sundown to pay the ransom. But who would need such a weak leader?"
 es_orcish_flavour.3.a: "We will pay the ransom."
 es_orcish_flavour.3.b: "Kill the envoy and elect the new Chief!"
 es_orcish_flavour.4.t: "Successful Campaign"
 es_orcish_flavour.4.d: "The military action against our enemies has been a huge success. Our warriors have brought home rich prey, and their exploits will long be legendary. Now it is high time to enjoy the results of our work and begin to prepare for new conquests."
 es_orcish_flavour.4.a: "War-ar!"
 es_orcish_flavour.5.t: "Fury of Orcs from [From.GetName]"
 es_orcish_flavour.5.d: "From all over the mountains and hills you can hear the wild howling of the hordes of orcs, whose fury does not know the limit. Soon, their wild flocks will gather together to sow chaos and horror in the expanse of Nirn. Get ready... Not everyone will be able to live to see the sunset of the next day."
