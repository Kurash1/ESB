 urban_blacklight: "Blacklight"
 urban_blacklight_desc: "Blacklight sits in an advantageous trade position, being the most northerly port in Morrowind that all western sea trade passes through on its way east. It is also the most commonly used departure point for sailors and merchants making the rough journey north to Solstheim. At some point after the Great Houses emerged Blacklight became the capital of House Redoran. During the 4th Era after the Argonian Accession War, Blacklight replaced Mournhold as the economic, political and administrative capital for the entirety of Morrowind."
 urban_balmora: "Balmora"
 urban_balmora_desc: "Balmora translates as 'Stonewood' or 'Stoneforest' in Ald Chimeris, the language of the Chimer. The city was built in a rocky valley along both sides of the Odai River, positioned directly on a major north-south trade route. The joint river and road connections offered convenient access to the city and many beneficial trade opportunities; over time Balmora grew to become the second-largest city on the island of Vvardenfell, behind Vivec only. During the 2nd Era House Redoran owned and developed the city but through savvy political manoeuvring House Hlaalu permanently came into possession of this profitable trade centre. Balmora was mostly destroyed in the 4th Era with the crashing of Baar Dau into Vivec, although rebuilding efforts took place after the devastation."
 urban_sadrith_mora: "Sadrith Mora"
 urban_sadrith_mora_desc: "Sadrith Mora translates as 'Forest of the Mushrooms' in Ald Chimeris, the language of the Chimer. Located on the largest island of Zafirbel Bay, this Telvanni city was likely 'built', or rather 'grown', in typical Telvanni fashion with stimulated magical growth being used on the local mushroom forest. The central tower and epicentre of activity were Tel Naga, which housed the Archmagister of House Telvanni in the 3rd Era. Although not the capital of House Telvanni, it did serve as the seat of the Telvanni Council given its convenient location to Vvardenfell and mainland politics. During the 3rd era, the Empire built a large fort, Wolverine Hall, near Sadrith Mora in an effort to plug themselves into local activities as well as establish a north-eastern Tamrielic outpost for the Septims."
 urban_firewatch: "Firewatch"
 urban_firewatch_desc: "Firewatch is said to be the closest 'major' mainland Velothi city to the peaks of Red Mountain. This trading port earned its name from the unobstructed and impeccable view of the volcano one has from the city. Firewatch's position on the northern tip of the Llothanis peninsula affords it convenient access to trade going through both the Inner Sea and the Sea of Ghosts."
 mountain_meadows: "Mountain Meadows"
 mountain_meadows_desc: "The valleys between high mountaintops experience a drier climate which allows farming even at higher elevations. The Mountain Meadows offer both grassland and a defensive surrounding."
 tundra: "Tundra"
 tundra_desc: "Tundra is a type of flatland found in the far north. The growth of trees is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The soil is mostly frozen and rocky, sustaining only durable grasses and cold-weather crops. Without trees, there is no natural protection from the cold wind."
 hot_springs: "Hot Springs"
 hot_springs_desc: "There are many hot springs in Tamriel wherever volcanic activity is found, as well as in the far North. It is not uncommon to see Nords or Ashlanders soaking in these mineral-rich waters for their healing properties and comfort amidst the cold."
 salt_plains: "Salt Plains"
 salt_plains_desc: "A salt plain occurs after the evaporation of a vast body of saltwater. Most salt plains in Tamriel are found along coastal lowlands. These lands are mostly vacant and harsh, but they do harbour rare minerals and make for great Saltrice plantations."
 ashlands: "Ashlands"
 ashlands_desc: "The Ashlands are continuously created from the regular fall of ash from Red Mountain and the intermittent lava flows that rush down the Foyadas of Vvardenfell. Although they seem desolate, the Ashlands are teeming with various types of wildlife, tough plants, and they can fully support the Nomadic lifestyles of the Velothi people. Many Daedric temples of the House of Corners are found in the Ashlands and lesser daedra often wander the region freely."
 fungal_forest: "Fungal Forest"
 fungal_forest_desc: "Nowhere is more famous for its Fungal Forests than Morrowind. Their presence is largely attributed to the humidity of the region and the warmth of Red Mountain. Fungal forests can grow as far north as Dagon Fel and as far south as Argonia. They are full of flora and fauna and some of the region's rarest alchemical ingredients are found amongst these mushroom trees. Telvanni Towers, and their surrounding plant-cities, are typically grown from a variant of these Fungi, whose growth is stimulated by soul gem magicks and various other enchantments."
 lava: "Lava Flow"
 lava_desc: "Although Red Mountain is mostly dormant, it still has active lava flows in the immediate area. These regions are nearly impossible to traverse or settle but are full of rich metals fresh from Nirn's crust that makes them appealing. Only the Dwemer knew how to permanently build in these regions safely; the Ashlanders nomadically roamed around them."
 taiga: "Taiga"
 taiga_desc: "Taiga is a type of swampy coniferous forest only found in the far north. Their wood is durable and is used often in Nordic boat-making. Skyrim, Atmora, and Raven Rock are where most Taiga in Tamriel is found."
 mudflats: "Mudflats"
 mudflats_desc: "Mudflats are coastal wetlands that form in inter-tidal areas where sediments have been deposited by tides or rivers. These regions are often found near lakes, rivers, bays and estuaries."
 barrow: "Barrow"
 barrow_desc: "Atmorans and Nords bury their important dead according to tradition - A burial cavern is dug out, walls and doors built-in, then an important figure and his bodyguard are laid to rest alongside each other for their journey to Sovngarde. Often, Barrows are full of rare treasures, as well as Draugr - unliving ancestors come back to defend their Barrow."
 bayou: "Bayou"
 bayou_desc: "The Bayou is a swampy region with lots of trees and small patches of land. They are usually connected to a river or fresh-water source flowing into them. In Tamriel, most Bayou can be found in Morrowind and Argonia. They are difficult to navigate and uncomfortable to live in, making them great spots for smuggling operations."
 dwemer_stronghold: "Dwemer Stronghold"
 dwemer_stronghold_desc: "The Dwemer, or People of the Deep, were a race of mer that preferred to live underground. The dwemer were adept at smithing and enchanting, enabling them to build large underground holds in some of the harshest terrain of all Tamriel, including Red Mountain. Some of the dwemer strongholds in Skyrim are known to connect to each other through the large underground networks that the Blackreach exposed."
 urban_red_mountain: "Red Mountain"
 urban_red_mountain_desc: "Red Mountain is a massive volcano at the heart of the Vvardenfell isle. Although mostly dormant, the volcano still has active lava flows and foyadas that the lava rushes down from. This is the harshest environment to survive in all of Tamriel. Red Mountain is also known as The Red Tower, as it hosts the Heart of Lorkhan in its depths and is one of the Sixteen Towers upon which the reality of Nirn is built. The Dwemer named this region Vvardenfell, which means City of the Strong Shield in the Dwemeris language."
 urban_mournhold: "Mournhold"
 urban_mournhold_desc: "Mournhold - City of Light, City of Magic! Also known as the City of Gems and the City of Love and Charity. During the Merethic Era, Mournhold competed with Old Ebonheart to be the economic and political capital of Morrowind. After a single family, Clan Ra'Aathim, gained control of both cities Mournhold became the formal capital of the Chimer. Mournhold was also the capital city of the Tribunal God Almalexia and her Daedric anticipation, Boethiah."
 urban_kogoruhn: "Kogoruhn"
 urban_kogoruhn_desc: "Kogoruhn means 'Unbreakable Home' in Aldmeris, and was the fortress-city capital of House Dagoth. Originally the region was a safe nomadic spot for the Dagoth Velothi tribe. However, with the invasion of the Nords and their Old Kingdom, a series of fortresses were commissioned around Vvardenfell to protect from the Nords, including Kogoruhn."
 urban_ald_ruhn: "Ald'Ruhn"
 urban_ald_ruhn_desc: "Ald-Ruhn means Old Home in Aldmeris and was originally a neutral meeting ground for the Ashlander tribes. The settlement grew in and around the shell of a giant Emperor Crab, Skar, that was killed by Dranoth of House Hleran with the help of the four Ashkhans of the major tribes. The noble district of the city is located inside this enormous shell, referred to as 'Under-Skar'. Control of the city was contested between the Great Houses and Ashlanders but in the 2nd Era House Redoran took final control and began to formally expand upon the existing sprawl around Skar."
 urban_necrom: "Necrom"
 urban_necrom_desc: "Necrom, or the City of the Dead, is where the most famous or influential Velothi are buried. According to Velothi tradition (and later Temple tradition), the remains of the deceased are typically cremated and placed in open burial pits for shrine worship, or inside burial urns for preservation. Necrom has long been affiliated with the Indoril, the most devout worshippers of the Velothi."
 urban_narsis: "Narsis"
 urban_narsis_desc: "Narsis-Where-All-Fervently-Praise-the-Prophet-Veloth, most commonly referred to as Narsis, is one of the original settlements of the Velothi. The building of Narsis marked the end of their long lifestyle of nomadic exile and slowly began the process of civilizing the Velothi into the Chimer. This city was largely affiliated with the Hlaalu, who used its position near Argonia and Cyrodiil to become a trade centre."
 urban_tear: "Tear"
 urban_tear_desc: "Tear has always been the home of the Dres, who gained significance from their very successful slave raids into nearby Black Marsh. Tear has long been known as the centre of the slave trade in Morrowind, and due to its proximity to Argonia has never lacked for slaves. The Dres established a fearsome legacy of trained argonians whom they used as slave-hunters."
 urban_telvannis: "Port Telvannis"
 urban_telvannis_desc: "Port Telvannis is the isolated island capital of the magical Telvanni. Partially grown, partially built by hand, the city is a shining example of Old Velothi architecture mixed with the uncontrolled fungal growth the Telvanni so love to build with. There are few laws here, as magical supremacy is the only true basis for determining who has authority.  Port Telvannis has a hearty slave trade mixed with a vibrant economy of illegal and smuggled goods, all of which the Telvanni tolerate in the name of their independence and pursuit of power."
 urban_ebonheart: "Ebonheart"
 urban_ebonheart_desc: "Ebonheart, also known as the Black City, has been described as the eldest city-state of Morrowind. It is the ancestral holding of Clan Ra'athim, a mixed heritage Chimer-Nordic family whose wealth came from mining ebony in the region. Ebonheart was the first informal 'capital' of Morrowind and was where the first High Kingship was declared by Moraelyn Ra'athim shortly after pushing the Nords out of Morrowind in 1E416. Ebonheart was a rival of Mournhold during the first era, competing to be the centre of Morrowind's politics and trade as well as the seat of the High King - when situations allowed for one. Although Mournhold 'won' the rival competition and became the capital Ebonheart remained an economically powerful city well into the end of the 3rd Era. During these later eras, Ebonheart had an entire Argonian Quarter of the city where the House slaves lived; permission was given for a Hist to be planted here as well." 
 urban_nchardak: "Nchardak"
 urban_nchardak_desc: "Nchardak was known as the 'City of a Hundred Towers'. It is recorded to be one of the largest and possibly most advanced of the Dwemer Archives, holding vast amounts of dwemer secrets within. Like most dwemer cities, Nchardak itself was a feat of engineering. Using a complex system of pipes and pumps the hold was able to submerge and emerge its entrances to avoid invasion. Nchardak was also known as a major centre of military production - it was said to be capable of producing a single automaton every day, an achievement no other dwemer hold accomplished."
 urban_galom_daeus: "Galom Daeus"
 urban_galom_daeus_desc: "Galom Daeus was most notably known for its observatory - the only of its kind to be built on Vvardenfell and one of but a few that the Dwemer were confirmed to have built across all Tamriel. As such, the hold itself would have been a major centre of astrological studies and was likely very closely connected to Kagrenac's broader study of metaphysical law. Dwemer's understanding of the cosmos was not just comprehensive but astounding in most circumstances - It is likely throughout history that only a handful of men and mer have understood as much as Dwemer did about Nirn's complicated universe."
 urban_kemel_ze: "Kemel-Ze"
 urban_kemel_ze_desc: "Kemel-Ze, sometimes called the 'Cliff City', was one of the largest Dwemer holds ever constructed. The number of connected chambers suggests it was simultaneously a major centre of population, trade, production, and scientific studies alike. It's possible this city began as much smaller Dwemer holds that ended up merging into one conglomerate over time. The hold itself had a fabled Dwemer-built Observatory in its upper towers, of which only a few in Tamriel existed. Some signs indicate also the hold maintained a regular royal presence or dignitary of a distinguished Dwemer family - perhaps even some sort of 'reserved' quarters for when any ruling authority was visiting, whether they be Mage-Crafter, Dwarf-King or Ashlander Hortator. The most famous expedition into Kemel-Ze revealed a wealth-filled hidden chamber with a frieze on the wall which 'seemed to depict an ancient ritual of some kind, with a long line of classically-bearded Dwarven elders processing down the sidewalls, all seemingly bowing to the giant form of a god carved into the front wall of the chamber, which was caught in the act of stepping forth from the crater of a mountain in a cloud of smoke or steam.' - from 'The Ruins of Kemel-Ze'. This is an indication that some Dwemer here, likely powerful mage-crafters in positions of rank in society, were both aware of and a part of Kagrenac's plan surrounding the Anumidium and its construction."
 urban_bamz_amschend: "Bamz-Amschend"
 urban_bamz_amschend_desc: "Bamz-Amschend was unique in its location, sitting right next to and eventually underneath the city of Mournhold; it is likely Mournhold started as a major trading centre near the entrance of Bamz-Amschend itself and then built over it after the Dwemer disappearance. Within Bamz-Amschend was a phenomenon of Dwemer engineering - the Karstangz-Bcharn, or 'Weather Witch' as some called it. This device was built during a time of drought and need, creating rain in the skies above. It was a versatile device, able to manifest any type of desired weather in the region, including ash storms. This city was also responsible for the construction of Dwemer colossi Automaton, though may have only built them during the War of the First Council as a last-minute defensive measure."
 urban_forelhost: "Forelhost"
 urban_forelhost_desc: "Forelhost served as a great monastery-fortress for the theocratic Dragon Cult based in Skyrim. Two Dragon Priests and their Masks were stationed here permanently - Rahgot and Vosis. At the end of the Dragon, War Forelhost served as the last holdout of those still loyal to the Cult. It fell to High King Harald, founder of the Kingdom of Skyrim, in 1E139. Before the besiegers could take the monastery the remaining Cult members all commit suicide, leaving none alive for capture when the Nords finally came through the gates. A grisly scene awaited the attackers, signifying the end of the Dragon Cult's brutal reign in Skyrim."
 urban_frulthuul: "Frulthuul"
 urban_frulthuul_desc: "Frulthuul was built by the Dragon Cult during their golden age of expansion. Its construction and architecture are similar to the Cult's other holdings found throughout Skyrim. In the 4th era, it was occupied by Roscrea's Bear Cult."
 deadlands_ashen_wastes: "Ashen Wastes"
 deadlands_ashen_wastes_desc: "The Ashen Wastes are a choking desert covered in ash that is constantly pushed forth from the surrounding volcanic peaks of the Deadlands. Visibility here is low due to the unsettled ash in the air. There are husks of many dead trees here, though it is unknown if any ever grew under Dagon or simply appeared this way. Compared to the rest of the Deadlands the Ashen Wastes are some of the more stable areas to build in, lacking the constant volcanic activity of the other terrain."
 deadlands_smouldering_badlands: "Smouldering Badlands"
 deadlands_smouldering_badlands_desc: "The Smouldering Badlands are the flatter areas of the Deadlands full of decaying structures, withering plants, scattered fires and the occasional volcanic vent. Many things have been built here over time only to be destroyed during Dremoran wars or eventual volcanic destruction. It is easier to develop than most areas in the Deadlands due to the somewhat-reliable stability of the terrain and distance from volcanic peaks."
 deadlands_boiling_coast: "Boiling Coast"
 deadlands_boiling_coast_desc: "The Deadlands is surrounded by an 'ocean' of lava that is constantly being filled by the unending river flows that come from the volcanic peaks. The levels or 'tides' of the lava can rise and fall along the Boiling Coast; paired with unreliable lava waves that come rushing in development of this terrain can be difficult and costly."
 deadlands_burning_hills: "Burning Hills"
 deadlands_burning_hills_desc: "The Burning Hills are a collection of irregular lava rivers flowing through scattered foyadas; they flow downhill from the larger volcanic peaks of the Deadlands. Smaller vents coming off of the larger peaks often push through in this difficult terrain, making development and travel through these provinces difficult and unappealing."
 deadlands_daedric_keep: "Daedric Keep"
 deadlands_daedric_keep_desc: "Daedric Keeps are centres of authoritarian power throughout the Deadlands. Reflections of their Lord Mehrunes Dagon, these sharp and intimidating structures dominate the desolation of the Deadlands. They are operated by the strongest Valkynaz who seizes control of the Keep, often being centres of militant slaving and planning the war with neighbours. During the Oblivion Crisis, the Daedric Keeps hosted the powerful Sigil Stones in the fortified upper room called the 'Sigillum Sanguis'. These Stones maintained the Oblivion Gates into Tamriel until closed by mortals able to enter into the Deadlands and manually destroy them."
 deadlands_volcanic_peak: "Volcanic Peak"
 deadlands_volcanic_peak_desc: "The Volcanic Peaks of the Deadlands are symbols of Lord Dagon Himself, violently and constantly changing the land with their enormous and infinitely destructive force. It is likely all mountain peaks in the Deadlands are volcanic, though not all are active. However, a formerly active peak can 'reignite' at any given time and reshape the land around it."
 deadlands_lava_cave: "Lava Cave"
 deadlands_lava_cave_desc: "Volcanic activity often creates underground caves in the surrounding region. These tubes are formed when flowing lava from a volcanic vent moves beneath the surface of a hardened lava flow. They are common in the Deadlands and some can be used to traverse from one area to another."
 deadlands_sulfuric_desolation: "Sulfuric Desolation"
 deadlands_sulfuric_desolation_desc: "This caustic terrain is extremely rocky and full of stagnant sulfur pools. It makes navigation very difficult and only the toughest Daedric weeds are capable of surviving here."
 urban_ardent_hope: "Ardent Hope"
 urban_ardent_hope_desc: "Ardent Hope was a vast Daedric citadel in the Deadlands. It dominated control of the region and protected the Path of Cinders which was the only ascent to Xarxes Crucible - a massive volcano in the region closely affiliated with Mehrunes Dagon and His favour." 
 urban_mehrunes_dagon: "Mehrunes Dagon's Citadel"
 urban_mehrunes_dagon_desc: "Mehrunes Dagon Himself often resides in His Citadel in the Great Lava Lake of the Deadlands. This fortress is nigh impregnable and is incredibly dangerous to any who dare assault it. When not found in His Citadel Dagon is usually out personally inspecting his Xivilai and Dremoran slave-servants at their respective Keeps."
 urban_jynds_foundry: "Jynd's Foundry"
 urban_jynds_foundry_desc: "Founded by Dremoran Kynmarcher Jynd, here the Daedra supervise the study, design and construction of various relics, artefacts, magical devices and enchanted machines. The knowledge here is reserved for those who can seize and control the Foundry."
 urban_zynoahzs_gaol: "Zynoahz's Gaol"
 urban_zynoahzs_gaol_desc: "Established by the Xivilai Zynoahz, this jail primarily serves as a centre for the buying, selling and storing of slaves. Mortal souls who served Dagon in life are trapped in the Deadlands forever - enslaving these souls and forcing them to fight or work is common practise amongst the more powerful Daedra here."
 urban_wretched_spire: "The Wretched Spire"
 urban_wretched_spire_desc: "Once a part of Mournhold, the Wretched Spire was ripped from Nirn by Mehrunes Dagon in the first era. The town is somewhat hidden in the sulfuric desolation of the Deadlands and is occupied by both Daedra and Dunmer alike working together to evade Dagon's malicious Will."
 urban_world_breaker: "World Breaker"
 urban_world_breaker_desc: "This massive fortress-complex was one of Mehrunes' biggest in the Deadlands. One of its purposes was for the construction and storage of the 'Siege Crawler' - this enormous walking siege engine was imbued with immense fire magics and was used in Mehrunes' assault against Bruma during the 3rd Era Oblivion Crisis."
 urban_razorworks: "The Razorworks"
 urban_razorworks_desc: "The Razorworks is a protected region used for a variety of smithing and crafting efforts by lesser daedra, man and mer alike. Daring armourers, weaponsmiths and jewel crafters who desired to create the enchanted Deadlands Demolisher items would travel to this site to learn their protected smithing secrets."
 urban_vivec: "Vivec"
 urban_vivec_desc: "Likely populated as a trading port near the shrine of Ald Sotha, Vivec City truly started to appear after the rise of the Tribunal in the year 700. Once Vivec was declared Head of the Tribunal, He had a large semi-floating Palace 'canton' constructed in Norvayn Bay to create a new capital city from where He could live, rule and dream. As pilgrims frequented the location and needs for various services grew additional cantons were constructed. By the 3rd era, there were nine cantons connected by bridges and walkways, with a series of waterways between them all that allowed for further transport and mobility amidst the urban islands. Vivec city served as an economic and religious centre for the island of Vvardenfell during its long existence. The city guard was constituted almost exclusively of Temple Ordinators - Morrowind's most elite and feared warriors. Early on in its emergence, Sheogorath hurled a large meteor at the city in mockery of the Tribunal's so-called claim to 'Divinity'. Vivec stopped this rock, Baar Dau, where it remained frozen in momentum for thousands of years until it came crashing down thousands of years later after Vivec's disappearance, destroying the city in its entirety."
