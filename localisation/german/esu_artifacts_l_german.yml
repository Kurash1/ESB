 auriels_bow: "Auriels Bow"
 auriels_bow_desc: "Auriels Bow appears as a modest Elven Longbow, but it is one of the mightiest ever to exist in Tamriels history. Allegedly created and used, like its sister Auriels Shield, by the great Elvish demi-god, the Bow can turn any arrow into a missile of death and destruction. Without Auriels power behind it, however, the bow uses its own store of energy for its power. Once exhausted of this energy, the bow will vanish and reappear whereever chance puts it. Its most recent appearances have been the subject of gossip for hundreds of years."
 auriels_shield: "Auriels Shield"
 auriels_shield_desc: "Auriels Shield, an Ebony shield said to have once belonged to the quasi-mythical Elvish deity Auriel, can make its wielder nigh invulnerable. In its resistance to fire and magick, Auriels Shield is unsurpassed. To defend its wielder from any attacks it cannot absorb, the Shield lends him or her health. Like many artifacts of Tamriel, the Shield has life and personality of its own, and does not feel bound to its user. A popular fable tells the tale of it abandoning one wielder in her greatest hour of need, but this is perhaps, apocryphal."
 azuras_star: "Azuras Star"
 azuras_star_desc: "Few mortals have the stomach to trade in souls. The Dark Brotherhood does it, as do certain groups within the Mages Guild. For these cruel folk, Azuras Star has a particular fascination. The Star acts as a reusable soul gem. The soul of any creature killed by the bearer of the Star is trapped within it. If the Star already carries a soul, nothing happens. Using Azuras Star empties it, freeing the trapped soul to make its journey to Oblivion. Azuras Star can be used to make magical items over and over and over."
 ebony_blade: "Ebony Blade"
 ebony_blade_desc: "The Ebony Blade, sometimes called the Vampire or the Leech, resembles an ebony katana, but its power is very dark indeed. Every time the Ebony Blade strikes an opponent, part of the damage inflicted flows into the wielder as raw power. The Blade itself may not be any more evil than those who have used it, but at some point in its long existence, a charm was cast on it so it would not remain with one bladesman. The wizard who cast this charm sought to save the souls of any too infatuated by the Blade, and perhaps he was right..."
 ebonys_mail: "Ebonys Mail"
 ebonys_mail_desc: "I am alive because that one is dead. I exist because I have the will to do so. And I shall remain as long as there are signs of my handwork, such as the blood dripping from this blade. Accepting my gift, she nodded and said: Indeed."
 hircines_ring: "Hircines Ring"
 hircines_ring_desc: "The curse of lycanthropy has its advantages. The incredible strength, speed, ferocity of a werebeast makes it a fearsome opponent. There are, of course, disadvantages. The bearer of the Hircine Ring can choose when to be a lycanthrope and when not. Essentially this gives him all the advantages with few of the negatives."
 chrysamere: "Chrysamere"
 chrysamere_desc: "Chrysamere, the Paladins Blade and Sword of Heroes, is an ancient claymore with offensive capabilities only surpassed by its defenses. It lends the wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects any deletory spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not to favor one champion."
 king_orgnums_coffer1: "King Orgnums Coffer"
 king_orgnums_coffer1_desc: "King Orghums Coffer is a small-sized chest, ordinary in appearance. It is remarkably light, almost weightless, which offers a clue to its true magic. Once a day, the Coffer will create gold from naught. When King Orghum himself possessed the Coffer, the supply within was limitless. Those who have found it since report that the Coffer eventually disappears after having dispersed enough gold to shame even the wealthiest of merchants. Where and why it vanishes is still a mystery."

 lords_mail: "Lords Mail"
 lords_mail_desc: "It is an ancient plated adamantium, mithril, or ebony cuirass of unsurpassable quality, considered to be heavy armor. It grants the wearer the power to absorb or regenerate health, resist the effects of spells, and resist or even cure poison. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer unworthy, the Lords Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one. The Mail was originally owned during the Merethic Era by the bull Morihaus, a demigod and early cultural hero of the Cyro-Nordics who was closely associated with Kynareth and the Lord. The cuirass was rumored to have later been taken from Morihaus by Kynareth herself due to his arrogance. The cuirass is sacred to the Imperial Legion and the Imperial Cult, and is accepted as uniform in the Legion. Indeed, the armor has been known to bear the red dragon sigil of the Third Empire on its breastplate."
 mace_of_molag_bal: "Mace of Molag Bal"
 mace_of_molag_bal_desc: "Also known as the Vampires Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its victims of spell points and gives them to the bearer. If the victim has no spell points, he is drained of strength, which is also transferred to the wielder. Using the Mace of Molag Bal can actually give its bearer more spell points or more strength than he would have fully rested. However, these bonus points are temporary. Molag Bal has been quite free with his artifact. There are many legends about the mace. It seems to be a favorite for vanquishing mad wizards."
 masque_of_clavicus_vile: "Masque of Clavicus Vile"
 masque_of_clavicus_vile_desc: "Ever the vain one, Clavicus Vile made a masque suited to his own personality. The bearer of the masque is more likely to get a positive response from the people of Tamriel. The higher his personality, the larger the bonus. The best known story of the masque tells the tale of Avalea, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the masque in return. Though the masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well connected baron, Clavicus reclaimed his masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the barons household. Twenty-one years and one day later, Avaleas daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the baron."
 mehrunes_razor: "Mehrunes Razor"
 mehrunes_razor_desc: "The Dark Brotherhood has covetted this ebony dagger for generations. This mythical artifact is capable of slaying any creature instantly. Victims of the Razor must save vs. magic or be slain. History does not record any bearers of Mehrunes Razor. However, eighty years ago the Dark Brotherhood was decimated by a vicious internal power struggle. It is suspected that the razor was involved."
 necromancers_amulet: "Necromancers_Amulet"
 necromancers_amulet_desc: "The legendary Necromancers Amulet, the last surviving relic of the mad sorcerer Mannimarco, grants any spellcaster who wears it the ability to absorb magical energy and regenerate from injury. The Amulet is mystically fortified to give the person wearing it an armor rating equivalent to plate armor, without the weight and restriction of movement. This makes the artifact popular amongst thieves and mages alike. It is the one flaw of the Amulet that it is unstable in this world - forever doomed to fade in and out of existence, reappearing at locations distant from that of its disappearance."
 ring_of_khajiit: "Ring of Khajiit"
 ring_of_khajiit_desc: "The Ring of the Khajiiti is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older than Rajhin, the thief who made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used the Rings powers to make himself as invisible, silent, and quick as a breath of wind. Using the Ring he became the most successful burglar in Elsweyrs history. Rajhins eventual fate is a mystery, but according to legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared, leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies..."
 ring_of_namira: "Ring of Namira"
 ring_of_namira_desc: "Namira is aligned with the darker side of nature, as is her ring. While the ring is being worn, any damage the bearer takes is suffered by the attacker as well. Spells and missile attacks are ignored. How much damage the attacker suffers depends upon his nature. Animals and Spriggans take no damage, being creatures of natures. Daedric beings only take half the damage they do, being supernatural creatures. Humanoids and monsters take full damage. Undead take twice the damage they dole out, because they are wholly unnatural creatures."
 ring_of_phynaster: "Ring of Phynaster"
 ring_of_phynaster_desc: "The Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a person who needed good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring, Phynaster lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from person to person. The ring improves its wearers overall resistance to damage and grants total immunity to poison, spells, and electricity. Still, Phynaster was cunning and said to have cursed the Ring. It eventually disappears from its holders possessions and returns to another resting place, uncontent to stay anywhere but with Phynaster himself."
 skeleton_key: "Skeleton Key"
 skeleton_key_desc: "The power of the Skeleton Key is very simple, indeed. With it, any non-magically locked door or chest is instantly accessible to even the clumsiest of lockpickers. A particularly skillful lockpicker may even open some magically barred doors with the Key. The two limitations placed on the Key by wizards who sought to protect their storehouses were that the Key could only be used once a day and it would never be the property of one thief for too long. Some of those who have possessed the Key have made themselves rich before it disappeared, others have broken into places they never should have entered ..."
 skull_of_corruption: "Skull of Corruption"
 skull_of_corruption_desc: "Using the Skull of Corruption on an opponent creates a duplicate of the victim. However, this duplicate will attack the original, not the wielder of the Skull. There is a story about the Thieves Guild Master and the skull that is probably fiction, but highly amusing. The Master used the skull on her enemy, creating a clone of him to fight. After defeating the original, the clever duplicate snatched the Skull from the Master and used it on her. Although the cloned enemy could not directly attack the Master, it could use the Skull to create a duplicate Master. The two clones jointly ruled the Thieves Guild for years."
 spell_breaker: "Spell Breaker"
 spell_breaker_desc: "Spell Breaker, superficially a Dwarven tower shield, is one of the most prized ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historic importance dating from the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost completely from any spellcaster, either by dispelling magicks or silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that the Spell Breaker still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of any one else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any time is power enough."
 staff_of_magnus: "Staff of Magnus"
 staff_of_magnus_desc: "The Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, the Arch-Mage Magnus. When used, it regenerates both a mages health and mystical energy at remarkable rates. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he or she becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical balance it is sworn to protect."
 volendrung: "Volendrung"
 volendrung_desc: "The Hammer of Might, Volendrung is said to have been created by the Dwarves of the now abandoned clan of Rourken, hundreds of years before they disappeared from the world of Tamriel. It has the ability to grant health to its wielder, but it is best known for the paralyzing and strength leeching effects it has when cast at an enemy. Like the Dwarves who created it, Volendrung is prone to disappearing suddenly, resurfacing sometimes in days, sometimes in eons."
 wabbajack: "Wabbajack"
 wabbajack_desc: "Madness and chaos are the trademarks of Sheogorath. The Wabbajack embodies these same traits. Using the artifact on a creature will transform it into something else. The creature can become any one of the following monsters: rat, imp, spriggan, giant bat, grizzly bear, spider, nymph, harpy, skeletal warrior, giant, zombie, giant scorpion, iron atronach, flesh atronach, ice atronach, fire atronach, lich. The problem is the bearer has no way of controlling the transformation. He could change a giant bat into a lich, or a fire atronach into a rat."
 warlocks_ring: "Warlocks Ring"
 warlocks_ring_desc: "The Warlocks Ring of the Arch-Mage Syrabane is one of the most popular relics of myth and fable. In Tamriels ancient history, Syrabane saved all of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it has helped adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its ability to reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her speed and health, though it may have additional powers. No adventurer can wear the Warlocks Ring for long, for it is said the Ring is Syrabanes alone to command."
 amulet_of_heartfire: "Amulet of Heartfire"

 bipolarblade: "BiPolar Blade"
 bipolarblade_desc: "Legend has it that a nobleman sank his fortune into creating a blade of supreme power. Two smiths on opposite ends of Tamriel created each half of the blade, unaware of the other, with the hope that no one man, save the owner of the blade, would know its true power. Unfortunately, the smiths were not given enough instruction, and created halves with enchantments that completely negated each other."

 bloodworm_helm: "Bloodworm Helm"
 bloodworm_helm_desc: "The Bloodworm Helm is the necromantic crown of the famed lich Mannimarco, who magically constructed it out of trollbone. Although beautiful to behold, many find the artifact repulsive due to its morbid nature. The helm grants the wearer greater skill at Conjuration, as well as the ability to turn the undead, drain the essence of enemies, and summon a skeletal minion. If the wearer is undead, their attacks are also made more powerful. Mannimarco left the helm behind when he ascended to godhood during the Warp in the West."
 boots_of_the_apostle: "Boots of the Apostle"
 boots_of_the_apostle_desc: "When Talos Stormcrown was a young man in Skyrim, he went into the mountains to learn the secrets of the Greybeards. He learned the secrets of the high peak winds -- the roar of the winter blast, and the warm silk of the summer updrafts. When he descended from the mountains, he came riding the clouds, striding through the air in great boots he claimed were gifts of the Greybeards for his cunning craft and riddling. After Septim yielded his crown, the boots disappeared, and have been lost for many years."

 bow_of_shadows_desc: "Legend has it that the Bow of Shadows was forged by the Daedra Nocturnal. The legendary ranger, Raerlas Ghile, was granted the Bow for a secret mission that failed, and the Bow was lost. Raerlas did not go down without a hearty fight and is said to have, with the aid of the Bow, taken scores of his foes with him. The Bow grants the user the ability of invisibility and increased speed. Many sightings of the Bow of Shadows have been reported, and it is even said that the sinister Dark Elf assassin of the Second Era, Dram, once wielded this bow."

If you return when Patriarch of the Temple she will give you this artifact back to keep."
 daedric_crescent: "Daedric Crescent"
 daedric_crescent_desc: "Probably the most rare and even outlawed item of all the great prizes is the Daedric Crescent Blade. The Blade was used by Mehrunes Dagon's Daedric forces in the capture of the Imperial Battlespire. These extremely unique Blades were gathered up and destroyed after the Battlespire was recaptured by the Empire. All but one it seems. Though the Empire believes them all to be destroyed, it is rumored that one still remains in existence, somewhere in Tamriel, though none have ever seen it. The Blade lends it's  wielder the ability to do great damage on an enemy and allows him to paralyze and put heavy wear on his enemy's armor.

 dragonbone_cuirass_desc: "This cuirass is one of the greatest artifacts any collector or hero could own. It is constructed of real dragon bone and was enchanted by the first Imperial Battlemage, Zurin Arctus, in the early years of the Third Era. It is a truly exquisite piece of work and many have sought to possess it. The properties of the Cuirass allow the wearer to completely resist fire, and to damage an enemy with a blast of fire. Little is known about the involvement of Zurin Arctus with the enchantment of the Cuirass, but an old tale speaks of a debt that he owed to a traveling warrior. Like the warrior, the Dragonbone Mail never stays put for long."

 fork_of_horripilation_desc: "This cursed fork drains 200 points of your Magicka when equipped, and does very little damage at that.

 goldbrand: "Goldbrand"
 goldbrand_desc: "The sword Goldbrand is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient dragons of the North.

The artifact was forged by one of the smiths of Dwemer Sorcerer-priest Kagrenac and blessed by the Daedric Goddess Azura.

The Moon-and-Star helped Nerevar unite the warring Chimer clans, and form the First Council which included the Dwemer.

 ring_of_surroundings_desc: "Once upon a time there was a bad magistrate who took gold from criminal organizations to reduce the sentences and fines of criminals. Everybody knew he was doing this, but nobody could prove it. Because even if it could be proved, the bad magistrate had important friends, and proof is not as powerful as important friends. At the same time there was a good officer who enforced the laws because he thought laws made people happy and safe. And it bothered the good officer that enforcing the laws did no good, because the bad magistrate let the criminals go as quick as the officer caught them. For a long time, the good officer sighed, and said, 'What can I do? Because the bad magistrate has important friends, and nothing I can do will touch him. But then, the good officer said, Say. Wait a minute. What about the bad people who are BRIBING the bad magistrate? THEY haven't got important friends. And if they aren't around, then the bad magistrate can't get any more bribes. And even better, the good officer suspected that the bad people who were bribing the bad magistrate were probably criminals themselves. So the good officer decided that it would be good if the bad people who were bribing the bad magistrate should go away. Forever.
