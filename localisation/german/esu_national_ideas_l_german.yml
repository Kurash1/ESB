She prayed and spoke with the Eight Divines and pleaded with Kyne that next time her son Morihaus flew down, he would join their cause and bring rage against the Ayleids. Kyne granted not only this but alongside the bull was Pelinal Whitestrake a fellow immortal ada. Both arrived to Alessia's camp of rebels with elven blood already spilled by their divine hands and announced to the Nedes that they had killed the eastern chieftains of the Ayleids. Thus formed the trilogy that would seek to simultaneously overthrow and install an Empire.

A Dragon Break is a phenomenon where linear time is broken, and becomes non-linear. The \"Dragon\" refers to Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time. A Dragon Break not only precedes significant changes in Tamriel, but challenges mortal comprehension. It is a re-alignment of time and space in response to an event which makes the normal continuity of reality impossible - AKA Bethesda retcons lore more often than Thalmor Justiciar says worshipping of Talos is forbidden."

A number of Tsaesci even served the Second Empire as Potentates, among them Sidri-Ashak, Versidue-Shaie, and Savirien-Chorak.

It was born early in the life of the Empire, during the First Era, and eventually faded into obscurity during the Second Era. It was founded by Ennon Decan as an order of knights dedicated to Akatosh, though originally it drew its members from the priesthood and military alike. The most recent incarnation of the Order of the Hour was established in 2E 432 by the warrior-priest of Akatosh, Cavor Merula, in response to the collapse of the Second Empire and the coming of the Longhouse Emperors. Fearing for the safety of the Dragon God priesthood and wanting to protect the Cathedral of Akatosh and its many historic and religiously significant treasures, Cavor gathered a few devoted and trusted fellow priests and dedicated himself and his brothers to the defense of the Cathedral.

 ca9_ideas_1_desc: "In its heyday, Garlas Malatar was ruled by King Narilmor, a zealous adherent of the Daedric Prince Meridia who dedicated his city to her veneration. It was said that Narilmor was one of Meridia's favorites, second only to the great Ayleid sorcerer-king Umaril the Unfeathered. Both the city and its ruler came to be regarded within the Ayleid Empire as the beacons of the west, and Meridia demonstrated her favor by granting Garlas Malatar the Guiding Light, a beacon powered by her light that shone above the city for miles around. Under King Narilmor's reign, Garlas Malatar thrived as a cosmopolitan port city and major trading hub. Its people wanted for nothing and revered their king as a fair and unbiased ruler, even if his penalties for minor infractions of Meridian law were viewed as harsh by outsiders."
 ca9_ideas_2: "All Flags Navy"
 ca9_ideas_2_desc: "The All Flags Navy was Tamriel's instrument of vengeance against the Sload of Thras, who were held responsible for releasing the Thrassian Plague in 1E 2200 which claimed more than half the continent's population. Formed under Baron-Admiral Bendu Olo, the Colovian King of Anvil, to deal justice upon them, the Navy was composed of ships and sailors from the Redguards, Bretons, Colovians, elves, and Argonians. According to some sources the fleet was composed of ships from all of provinces of Tamriel. Sometime around 1E 2260, they sailed to Thras, slaughtered all the Sload they could find, and used unknown magic to sink their kingdom into the sea."

 ca9_ideas_3_desc: "Mermaids are mythical creatures with a presence in the Abecean Sea. They resemble young women with a long fish tail instead of legs, but the nature of these creatures is unknown. The most well-known mermaid is the Mermaid of Anvil, an old stone statue that is beloved by the people of Anvil. The grandeur of the statue rivals other effigies dedicated to the Divines or even Daedric Princes leading many to believe that the mermaid statue is based on a long-forgotten deity. It was apparently built before any structure was made in Anvil, implying that the statue was the foundation of the county city's creation. It has been called many names, such as the Brine Maiden and the Salty Serenader."

One of the earliest known dynasties in Tamriel, its founding by King Eplear is an event traditionally regarded as the beginning of Year Zero of the First Era. Eplear's success in uniting the inherently wild Bosmer has been argued to be one of the greatest military feats in Tamriel's history. The Camorans remained in power for centuries afterwards, even resisting the aggressive expansion of the Alessian Empire, until Valenwood was conquered by the Second Empire in 1E 2714 following years of unrelenting warfare and the devastation of the Thrassian Plague. The Camoran Dynasty survived, but the Empire broke its influence by granting independence to Valenwood's lesser nobles."

 va3_ideas_3_desc: "Across the base of the tree is an intricate network of platforms, held together by thick vines and operated by ferrymen. They transport people across the city, from the ground floor to other districts across Falinesti. Despite where the seasonal sites are located, Falinesti has a port and it was one of the most significant stops in southwest Tamriel. One of these districts is called Havel Slump, located in the lower boughs of the tree. The streets are narrow but solid, as the book, \"A Dance in Fire\" explains, like the marble of the Imperial City. Curled webs of moss hang unevenly over the streets, forming a shared roof for several dozen small buildings. "
 va3_ideas_4: "Greenspeaker Architecture"
 va3_ideas_4_desc: "The Greenspeakers are Bosmeri practitioners of nature magic who work in tandem with the Green Pact to shape the environment into settlements such as villages and even cities. They enhance the growth of Graht-oak trees and branches to form furniture, weapons, and even housing called Pod-Homes. They also craft it into bridges and platforms, as well as gates and large temples. The Falinesti were considered the greatest greenspeakers in history and their end goal was to create the perfect fusion of city and forest, which led to the creation of modern-day Falinesti."

Its landscape consists mainly of rolling hills and light blue rivers, predominantly covered in rainforest and woodland. The coasts of Valenwood are dominated by mangrove swamps and tropical rain forests, while heavy rainfalls nurture the temperate inland rain forests."

 vlw_ideas_2_desc: "Do not harm the forests of Valenwood. Do not eat anything made from plant life. Eat only meat. When enemies are conquered, their meat must be eaten, not left to rot. Do not kill wastefully. Do not take on the shape of beasts."
 vlw_ideas_3: "Pragmatism Above Zealotry"
 vlw_ideas_3_desc: "Despite its perceived simplicity the Green Pact's doctrinal details can be baffling to outsiders, its certain aspects are often matters of dispute among the Bosmer. Picking up and consumption fallen fruits is not considered breach of Green Pact. Dairy products, honey, mushrooms, and insects are generally accepted meals in the Valenwood and eating them is not considered breach of the Green Pact by all but the most ultra-zealous of Pact Bosmer. Green Pact Bosmer are said to attack any who would harm the forest in which they live, which they call the Green. However, they usually don't mind other races cutting trees down (most notably in the case of Vinedusk Rangers and Wood Orcs in their respective territories), and are known to buy wood from them."
 vlw_ideas_4: "Wild Hunt"
 vlw_ideas_4_desc: "Bosmer shapeshifters are stripped of their flesh from their bone instantaneously, and turn into creatures that \"defy all attempts to identify them\". The forms they take are not static, however, as they may appear like a serpent one moment, and shift into another creature the next moment. When Bosmer invoke the Wild Hunt, it causes a change in wild animals as well. Beasts typically transform into beings that are part plant and part animal. The purpose of the Wild Hunt varies with each separate Hunt, from an act of vengeance to a tool of war. In either case, the Bosmer are not proud of their ability and are unwilling to discuss the Hunt at great length. One of the rare accounts on the nature of the Wild Hunt states that \"every monster in the world that has ever been comes from a previous Hunt\". As such, the Bosmer are reluctant to use the Hunt, except as an act of desperation."
 vlw_ideas_5: "Quick and Nimble"

 sor_ideas_1_desc: "Unlike their neighbors, the Wood Orcs do not adhere to the Green Pact and are free to exploit the environment, much to the dismay of the Bosmer. However, this brings a lot of business opportunities for these races, for example, the Wood Orcs main source of trade was from mining coal and kindlepitch, and selling to the Bosmer who cannot exploit the landscape in the same way, but still need fuel for their fires. Not to mention, the Wood Orcs are just as good at smithing than their northern cousins, so most, if not all of the Bosmer's metal tools and weapons comes from the Wood Orcs."
 sor_ideas_2: "The Taking of Abamath"
 sor_ideas_2_desc: "Wood Orcs pride themselves on the strength of their arms, their spirits, and their god. They know they can be beaten in battle, but never defeated. That pride and that belief betrayed them in Abamath. When Ayleid forces arrived at the Wood Orc town, the warriors painted themselves in the \"blood of Malacath\" and relied on their shamans' magic to protect them from the invaders. They stood strong and held. And then they broke. And died. And some few fled—a shame that haunts their descendants. The Ayleids took Abamath and turned it into their own demesne. The Wood Orcs remember their defeat and have turned it into a rallying cry. Many Wood Orcs—especially those who trace their ancestry back to the taking of Abamath—paint their faces red still, hoping to cleanse their shame with displays of renewed ferocity."

And across the land, from tavern to tavern, Faltonia's Promise had become nothing more than a punchline of a failed dream. But Salvius was not willing to give, and instead turned her town into a quarry-town. Faltonia Salvius was able to negotiate with the port-city of Haven, to supply the stone for their ruined buildings. But these changed when a charismatic Altmer Canonreeve persuaded Haven to build with imported Summerset stone. With essentially no money left, Faltonia Salvius had abandoned her settlement and those that came to seek wealth had spread across Grahtwood. From then on, Faltonia's Promise had become known as Goldfolly."

 img_ideas_2_desc: "These intelligent apes are said to have flourished in Valenwood long before the Aldmer ever arrived there. They cohabit in the forests with the Bosmer tribes, and also inhabit many of the abandoned human trading posts which had been established during the Second Empire."
 img_ideas_3: "Dextrous Ape-Men"
 img_ideas_3_desc: "I was invited to join with a small colony of Imga monkeys, who alone could gather these succulent little mice. Because they lived only on the slenderest branches of the trees, and only on the ends of those same branches, the Imga had to climb beneath them and jump up to \"pick\" the Kollopi from their perches. Imga are, of course, naturally dexterous, but I was then relatively young and spry, and they let me help them. While I could never jump as high they could, with practice, I found that if I kept my head and upper body rigid, and launched off the ground with a scissors-like kick, I could reach the Kollopi on the lowest branches of the tree. I believe I gathered three Kollopi myself, though with considerable effort."

 img_ideas_5: "Kollopi"
 img_ideas_5_desc: "In Falinesti, colonies of Imga apes gather Kollopi, an arboreal rodent, from the ends of the slenderest branches of the graht-oaks. These Kollopi are then used to make a simple peasant dish of the same name."

 img_ideas_7_desc: "The majority of Imga disappeared from Valenwood during the Alliance War and Planemeld, believed to be part of their time-tested strategy of hiding out during periods of warfare until the strife was safely over. The controversial Altmer author Cirantille believed that they went to 'visit Falinesti', which had already vanished from Tamriel centuries prior, so that they could wait out the end of the Planemeld and the Alliance War, though most of her peers disagreed with her opinion on the subject. It is unknown when or how the Imga returned."

 gre_ideas_1: "The Wilderking"
 gre_ideas_1_desc: "The Wilderking (or Wilderqueen) is a god worshipped by tribal Wood Elves in the pristine jungles of the Greenshade region of Valenwood. He dons a living crown made of knotted branches and leaves. The look of the crown along with his elusiveness caused him to be depicted as an Altmer with antlers. He is as much a political figurehead as a god, as these tribes answer to him rather than the King in Elden Root. The Wilderking is selective of those he appears to, which often causes outsiders to doubt his existence. He is so elusive in fact that rare sketches of him circulating were said to be extremely valuable to collectors and myth hunters."
 gre_ideas_2: "Rite of Theft"
 gre_ideas_2_desc: "Greenshade is home to many tribal Bosmer, who are known for being unfriendly to outsiders and for practicing the \"Rite of Theft\". Many merchants travel well-armed and stick close to major cities as a result. Old \"Merchant Tunnels\", which were dug so that legitimate businessmen could transport goods in relative safety, are now generally used instead for black-market smuggling and trading."
 gre_ideas_3: "Whisper Grove"
 gre_ideas_3_desc: "A graht-oak settlement located deep in the region's pristine jungles, many Bosmer who were unhappy with Valenwood joining the first Aldmeri Dominion retreated to Whisper Grove as a refuge. Later destroyed by Dagon worshippers"
 gre_ideas_4: "Drowned Coast"
 gre_ideas_4_desc: "The Drowned Coast is the westernmost region of the greater Greenshade region. The Drowned Coast is the home of the city of Woodhearth, the capital of Greenshade. The Northern area is mountainous with several Ayleid ruins scattered about, including Rulanyil's Fall. On the other side of the mountains is the fortress known as the Seaside Sanctuary, which safeguards the western shores of Valenwood. The southern area is riddled with swamps and is the home of the Keerilth Clan of Vampires, who haunt the nearby township of Longhaven. There also around four islands located in the ocean south of the coastline, the easternmost isle being the largest. Though they often appear on maps of Tamriel, little is known about them."
 gre_ideas_5: "Skooma Smuggling"
 gre_ideas_5_desc: "Woodhearth is considered one of the safer places in Valenwood for foreigners, despite skooma smuggling beyond the city's streets and the infamous Bosmer thieves. Beside drugs dealing, contraband of other products are also common through its extensive and partially abandoned Imperial sewers."
 gre_ideas_6: "Jugged Venison"
 gre_ideas_6_desc: "Every Wood Elf knows that the more inward the part, the better it tastes. While other races cook their meat until it is dry and bloodless, and waste entrails and brains, the Wood Elf knows that these parts are the juiciest and therefore the most flavorful."
 gre_ideas_7: "Resist the Civilizers"
 gre_ideas_7_desc: "In the Second Era, the Thalmor of the Aldmeri Dominion sought to 'civilize' the region, but met resistance in eradicating widespread practices, such as Daedra worship. Their construction of the town of Marbruk proved controversial due to the damage it caused to the Green of Valenwood."

 mal_ideas_1: "Malabal Tor"
 mal_ideas_1_desc: "Malabal Tor is a region deep in the jungles of northwestern Valenwood, where little light reaches the forest floor. The area is populated by hoarvors and stranglers and is the site of many Bosmer traditions, possibly including cannibalism. The city of Silvenar is the capital."
 mal_ideas_2: "Hoarvors"
 mal_ideas_2_desc: "Hoarvors are large ticks that drink blood to survive. They can generally be found among dense foliage and in damp locations. Riverbeds and filth-ridden areas are a good place to find them. Hoarvors are not quick to strike a lone enemy. However, in groups or in the presence of abundant food, they are known to strike swiftly and with ferocity. They don't hunt so much as they come upon their prey. Hoarvors will commonly feed on sleeping, injured, dead and dying creatures. They are skilled at locating areas of strong blood flow from which to feed, where they drink from using a proboscis."
 mal_ideas_3: "On Immortality"
 mal_ideas_3_desc: "It is rumored that several pools and springs throughout Tamriel can grant immortality. These places are often hidden in the most inaccessible and hard to reach places. Such places are rumored to exist deep in the swamps of Shadowfen, on the highest peaks of Rivenspire, and in an ancient glade of Malabal Tor. Explorers have sought out these places for centuries, and while many have returned with stories of their success, not one has yet thought to mark the locations on a map."
 mal_ideas_4: "The Silvenar"
 mal_ideas_4_desc: "The Silvenar is the Voice of the People for the Bosmer. While viewed by outsiders as a title for the Bosmer's political representative for foreign affairs, the Silvenar is more than a mere politician. Each person who bears the title is thought of as merely the Silvenar's aspect. The Silvenar represents the Bosmer people legally, physically, and emotionally. He is said to be their spirituality, in contrast to the Green Lady, who is their physicality. It is said to be the union of the two that makes Valenwood whole. He is inseparably tied to the Bosmeri people, and they to him, making him supernaturally empathic and aware of their concerns. They also believe that he looks after their spirits, as well as their bodies. As the Voice of the People, the Silvenar has many rights which grant him great authority in Valenwood. For one, only the Silvenar can grant foreign building and trade contracts, meaning any which wishes to build in Valenwood or do business with the Bosmer must deal with the Silvenar first."
 mal_ideas_5: "The Flower of Valenwood"
 mal_ideas_5_desc: "In a week's time, the little boat bumped along the shallow, calmer waters of the foaming current the Xylo had become, and Decumus Scotti first saw the city of Silvenar. If Falinesti was a tree, then Silvenar was a flower. A magnificent pile of faded shades of green, red, blue, and white, shining with crystalline residue."
 mal_ideas_6: "Green-Sap Tower"
 mal_ideas_6_desc: "The Bosmer did not build a Tower; they grew it, a great graht-oak whose roots sprang from a Perchance Acorn. This was their Stone. And because the Acorn might perchance have been elsewhere, thus was Green-Sap manifold and several. Each could walk, and sing their own songs. From the interplay of the manifold Green-Sap, the Bosmer learned the songs which \"made the trees dance\", and which dances they desired to perform. In other words, each Green-Sap was able to sing their own song, tell their own story — create their own reality. And the Bosmer took joy in this, and in picking the song which appealed to them, as it was a reflection of their own nature."
 mal_ideas_7: "Amber City"
 mal_ideas_7_desc: "The city of Silvenar uses an abundance of amber in its architecture and overall layout. According to some folklore, the town was once a glade of completely colorful trees, but the graht-oak sap began to flow and create a web of hardened amber that became the foundation of the modern-day city. There are bridges of amber and Silvenar's architecture is sometimes described as \"petrified.\""

 BA1_ideas_3_desc: "In 2E 541, Daggerfall was threatened by the Reachmen under Durcorach the Black Drake, whose army gathered in front of the city gates. However, the troops were attacked from behind by the army of Heavy Dragoons from Wayrest, who followed them aboard merchant ships. During the battle, Durcorach was slain by Emeric of Cumberland, and his banner was torn. This was a fatal blow to the Reachmen, and soon, the Knights of the Dragon under King Bergamot finished what the Dragoons had begun, scattering the remnants of Durcorach's army. Two weeks later, the kings of Daggerfall, Camlorn, Shornhelm, Wayrest, and Evermore signed the first Daggerfall Covenant."

The tower was then used by the Gods for discussing the punishment of Lorkhan for his trickery of conceptualizing Mundus, the decision being to cast Lorkhan's heart from the tower and into the mortal world below.

 hig_ideas_4_desc: "Dungeon interiors consist of one or more blocks defined in BLOCKS.BSA and referenced (per-dungeon) in MAPS.BSA, which are glued together to create the appropriate scene. Dungeons may have up to (and including) 32 of these blocks, some of which have two passages connecting to other blocks in each of the four cardinal directions. Even the smallest dungeon is multiple times bigger than largest city of Daggerfall. Daggerfall is the best elder scrolls game change my mind - Kurashi (2022)"
 hig_ideas_5: "Land of Adventures"
 hig_ideas_5_desc: "After you have played the game for a while, you will start to notice patterns to the dungeons. This is a by-product of the dungeon creation process. Daggerfall dungeons are modular. The Main Quest dungeons were painstakingly constructed by hand, but the random dungeons take pieces of the Main Quest dungeons (and other pieces) and sling them together in random forms. This is why players get a strange sense of "deja vu" in the random dungeons. They really have been here before. Once you reach this point, finding quest objects becomes much easier because each module only has one or two object locations."
 hig_ideas_6: "Breton Society"
 hig_ideas_6_desc: "Bretons are a human race of elven ancestry that inhabits High Rock. They are united in culture and language, but divided politically, for High Rock is fractious. Bretons make up the peasantry, soldiery, and magical elite of the feudal kingdoms competing for power within High Rock. Bretons are known for their intelligence and have a quick and perceptive grasp of spellcraft, enchantment, and alchemy. Even the humblest of Bretons can boast a high resistance to destructive and dominating magical energies."
 hig_ideas_7: "Warp in the West"
 hig_ideas_7_desc: "High Rock was eventually brought into the Third Empire by Tiber Septim during the Tiber Wars. Still divided, some did unite to try to stop the Camoran Usurper, yet he was not stopped until the Baron of Dwynnen united the citizens of the Iliac Bay against him. The Bretons would not remain united, and went back to fighting one another, and those outside of High Rock, until they had to unite when the Nords reclaimed their land in the War of Bend'r-Mahk, when they fought the Redguards in the War of Betony, and when the Orcs resurrected Orsinium. However they would be united in The Miracle of Peace. The 'Miracle of Peace' is celebrated as the product of the miraculous interventions of Stendarr, Mara, and Akatosh to transform this troublesome region into peaceful, well-governed Imperial counties. This event transformed High Rock from numerous city-states into five kingdoms."

 dir_ideas_2: "Feudal Overlords"
 dir_ideas_2_desc: "The Direnni didn't enslave the Nedes as the Ayleids of Cyrodiil did; instead, they ruled them as a noble caste. The elves established a system of feudal vassalage over their new subjects and took Nedic concubines. They inevitably interbred with their human subjects, producing half-elven children. The children begat from these unions weren't adopted by their Direnni parents, as they were considered sub-mer. Instead, they were given privileged positions among the Nedes, which eventually lead to a recognizable mixed-blood human caste dubbed "Bretons", from the Ehlnofex "beratu", meaning "half". These Bretons were only allowed to marry humans. Over time, their elven blood thinned, and their human features became more prominent."

In the Middle Merethic Era, Clan Direnni rediscovered and captured the Adamantine Tower. Some believe the Direnni were following their destiny to rule from Balfiera, while others believed that the clan was exiled. The Direnni's claim over the Isle of Balfiera was strengthened when it was purchased by Ryain Direnni in 1E 461."
 dir_ideas_4: "Direnni Clan"
 dir_ideas_4_desc: "Clan Direnni originated from the small farming village of Tyrigel which sat on the banks of the river Caomus (then called the river Diren hence the family's name) on Summerset Isle. Using his knowledge of alchemy, Asliel Direnni poisoned a barbarian tribe called the Locvar that were continuously raiding Tyrigel. With this external threat dealt with, the way was paved for the future prosperity of the Direnni farms, and generations later they would leave Summerset and travel to mainland Tamriel which would further increase their power and influence."
 dir_ideas_5: "Breton Takeover"
 dir_ideas_5_desc: "Thoroughly spent, the Direnni eventually retreated to Balfiera. Most of High Rock would be under Breton control by 1E 498, though the elves would be accepted and allowed to remain in the province for most of the Second Era. The Bretons' rise to prominence in High Rock initially started through villages being founded in tactical locations, such as Wayrest, which started as a fishing hamlet. Nordic cities such as Camlorn became Breton due to assimilation from the growing Breton population as opposed to conquest. Over time, the emerging Bretons absorbed the remaining Nordic population in High Rock, and the land would be definitively Breton by the end of the First Era."
 dir_ideas_6: "Atronach Mastery"
 dir_ideas_6_desc: "The master summoners of the Direnni were the first to discover that a conjurer could impose any desired shape on a Flame Atronach, such as that of a horse, which they used in the Battle of Glenumbria Moors. Peregrine Direnni was also the first to conjure the first ever Flame Atronach in the form of a flaming camel. Direnni were also known to utilize golems and quasigriffs."

It has been sacked and rebuilt many times over the centuries, as the Orcs are often at odds with their Breton and Redguard neighbors. Orsinium was first built in High Rock, straddling the boundary between western Wrothgar and Rivenspire. In the mid-Second Era, the city was relocated to eastern Wrothgar. In 3E 399, it was relocated again to a site between Wayrest, Menevia, and the Wrothgarian Mountains. By 4E 201, Orsinium had been moved a third time, farther south to an area between Hammerfell and Skyrim."
 ors_ideas_2: "Unified Nation"
 ors_ideas_2_desc: "After the transformation of the Orsimer deity known as Trinimac into the Daedric Prince Malacath, the Orcs, who transformed as well, fled to the northern wastes, near Saarthal. After hundreds of orcs, ogres, goblins, gremlins and other beastfolk were set free by the Altmer during the Camoran Dynasty, they chose to settle in an uninhabited mountain region close to Old Hroldan in High Rock, as their people were dependent on a rare, shaggy, giant centipede herd-beast that can only survive at high altitudes. In the tenth century of the First Era, chieftain Torug gro-Igron brought the Orcish people together and founded a village in the western Wrothgarian Mountains. Thanks to the cooperation of several Orcish clans, particularly Igrun, Morkul, Shatul, and Tumnosh, the village quickly grew into a great stone city. The first Orsinium drew the Orcs by its magnificence and Torug's vision of a united Orc nation."
 ors_ideas_3: "The Siege of Orsinium"
 ors_ideas_3_desc: "During the 30-year campaign, which became widely known as the 'Siege of Orsinium', the Breton armies of Daggerfall, the Redguard soldiers of Sentinel, and the Yokudan Order of Diagna invaded the Orc homeland. The Orcs gave much resistance and proved themselves to be fearsome and brutal warriors, just as they did in the past."

The land was then won back by the Orc hero Gortwog gro-Nagorm in 3E 399, who was disputing claim on the land, made by the Breton noble Lord Bowyn. Gortwog won the land by defeating Lord Bowyn in a duel. Named Nova Orsinium, the city was rebuilt on a mountainside between Menevia and Wayrest, at the site of Torug's original Orsinium. As the city harbored statues of Orc heroes such as Mauloch and Torug, and was built of iron, it was likely that Nova Orsinium would provoke the same reaction from its neighboring kingdoms as the first city did. However, the land prospered, as Gortwog proved to be a diplomatic as well as a political genius. Following the events of the Miracle of Peace, Gortwog used the Numidium to conquer substantial territory of central High Rock. Its application for elevation to Provincial status, which was proposed to Tiber Septim at the founding of the Third Empire, was finally beginning to be reviewed by Emperor Uriel Septim VII."

Chief Yashnag gro-Yazgu in particular succeeded in carving out a chiefdom in western Falkreath that persisted until 2E 467, when Yashnag and his champions were slain by Hakkvild Yashnag-Slayer, the Jarl of Falkreath, in a ritual of single-combat."

She then killed her mother, cut out her heart, and ate it. When Mercedene left the village, the Winterborn rode at her back as she usurped her mother's position and was then on called the 'Beast of the Reach'.

 way_ideas_1_desc: "Ask Lysandus what happened to him."
 way_ideas_2: "Harpy Nests"
 way_ideas_2_desc: "Harpies are a race of fierce, carnivorous, feminine humanoids with the wings of a bird. They are common nuisance around the Iliac Bay area, particularly in Lainlyn, but are found wherever there are rocky cliffs and crags suitable for their nests. They also build their nests in abandoned ruins. While their maniacal nature makes them somewhat less-than-brilliant tacticians, their sharp talons and frenzied behavior often force kingdoms to abandon lands to their use. Harpy feathers are everywhere."
 way_ideas_3: "Jewel of the Bay"
 way_ideas_3_desc: "Wayrest is one of the most glorious cities of western Tamriel: sparkling in her contemporary beauty, lustrous by her past. She is prized above all cities in High Rock -- no other city has contributed, and continues to contribute so much to the culture of the Bretons. The spirits of her genius children continue to haunt the streets; you can see them in the gabled roofs, grand boulevards, aromatic marketplaces. The people of Wayrest have an instictive (sic) appreciation of their past, but are not obsessed by it, as the people of Daggerfall seem to be. One feels that one is in a modern city when one visits Wayrest, but there is a magic in the air that could only come from thirty-two centuries of civilization."
 way_ideas_4: "City of Disasters"
 way_ideas_4_desc: "Wayrest has survived blights, droughts, plagues, piracy, invasions, and war with good humor and practicality. In 1E 2702, the entire population of the city was forced to move into the walled estate of the Gardners as protection against the pirates, Akaviri raiders, and Thrassian plague. A less resourceful community would have withered, but the Wayresters have survived to enrich Tamriel generation after generation."
 way_ideas_5: "Gardner Protectors"
 way_ideas_5_desc: "King of Wayrest in the Second Era, and the last member of the Gardner dynasty, descended from a merchant prince who was first proclaimed king. He expanded the city's walls and fortifications, allowing it to survive a 57-day siege by Durcorach's invading hordes in 2E 541. Wayrest's forces were instrumental in defeating the Reachmen, and in the aftermath, King Gardner joined with several other Breton kingdoms in signing the first Daggerfall Covenant, a pact of mutual defense. Wayrest thrived for many years afterwards, until the king was suddenly felled by the Knahaten Flu along with his entire family, ending the Gardner dynasty. He was succeeded by Emeric, of the Cumberland Dynasty, who would go on to form the second Daggerfall Covenant which vied for the Ruby Throne during the Interregnum."
 way_ideas_6: "Bjoulsae River"
 way_ideas_6_desc: "The Bjoulsae River is a major river that forms most of the border between Hammerfell and High Rock. It is the home of the River Horse Bretons, tribes of nomadic Bretons that live throughout the river and nearby Bangkorai."
 way_ideas_7: "Warp in the West"
 way_ideas_7_desc: "High Rock was eventually brought into the Third Empire by Tiber Septim during the Tiber Wars. Still divided, some did unite to try to stop the Camoran Usurper, yet he was not stopped until the Baron of Dwynnen united the citizens of the Iliac Bay against him. The Bretons would not remain united, and went back to fighting one another, and those outside of High Rock, until they had to unite when the Nords reclaimed their land in the War of Bend'r-Mahk, when they fought the Redguards in the War of Betony, and when the Orcs resurrected Orsinium. However they would be united in The Miracle of Peace. The 'Miracle of Peace' is celebrated as the product of the miraculous interventions of Stendarr, Mara, and Akatosh to transform this troublesome region into peaceful, well-governed Imperial counties. This event transformed High Rock from numerous city-states into five kingdoms."

 eve_ideas_3: "Pelin Veneration"
 eve_ideas_3_desc: "Saint Pelin the Martyr was a Breton priest of Stendarr that ascended to the role of sainthood following his divine act in the defense of the Bangkorai Garrison in 1E 1029, which in turn, brought the province of High Rock into the First Empire of Cyrodiil. He had become a folk hero to the Bretons of Evermore and the greater region of Bretonic-Bangkorai, memorialized by the chapel of St. Pelin in Evermore, the Order of Saint Pelin, the knightly order of the Kingdom of Evermore, and the great cemetery called Pelin Graveyard."
 eve_ideas_4: "River Horse Bretons"
 eve_ideas_4_desc: "The River Horse Bretons is the indigenous group of tribal Bretons that live in the Bjoulsae River region. While information on them is scarce, the horse-men are a nomadic, primitive folk that wear fur armor and bone necklaces, much like the Reachmen. As the name suggests, they are known for their horses. Their battle strategies and tactics are described as straight-forward, which is the "way of the horse men", in the book The Mirror."

 eve_ideas_6: "Bangkorai"
 eve_ideas_6_desc: "Many times throughout history, the soldiers of the Bangkorai Garrison have successfully stopped invaders from pouring through the Bangkorai Pass, protecting the lands beyond it from military conquest. In 1E 874, a horde of Orcs and goblins which had been displaced by the Redguards flowed west, but were denied passage at the Bangkorai Pass. They were forced to head northeast into the Dragontail Mountains in order to reach Orsinium. Then, in 1E 1029, when the Imperial Legion under Empress Hestra deposed King Styriche, the Vampire of Verkarth, he and his Gray Host fled west, burning and killing as they came, but were successfully stopped and routed at the Pass."

 CB8_ideas_bonus: "White-Gold Tower Ambition"
 cb8_ideas_1: "Ten Ancestors"
 cb8_ideas_1_desc: "The Ten Ancestors are a set of ten Ayleid statues. They consist mostly of meteoric iron prongs, with a shard of meteoric glass in the center. The statues played an important role in Ayleid religion and were displayed in the Temple of the Ancestors, now known as the White-Gold Tower. The temple of Loriasel was also built in Black Marsh by the Barsaebic Ayleids in veneration of the Ancestors. The Ancestors themselves were believed to worship the Daedra, and Daedraphile Ayleids accordingly followed the Eleven Edicts of the Ten Ancestors."
 cb8_ideas_2: "Sky Harvesting"
 cb8_ideas_2_desc: "Ayleids seem to have had a firm grasp of the magical arts, as many of their ruins contain stones filled with magicka essences harvested from the sky. The ancient Ayleids believed that Nirn was composed of four basic elements -- earth, water, air, and light -- and of these four elements, they believed the most sublime form of light was star light. The stars are our links to the plane of Aetherius, the source of all magical power, and therefore, light from the stars is the most potent and exalted of all magical powers. From time to time, fragments of Aetherius fall from the heavens. The people know these fragments as 'shooting stars', and from time to time, such Aetherial fragments are found on Nirn."
 cb8_ideas_3: "Merid-Nunda Faithful"
 cb8_ideas_3_desc: "Meridia (known as the Bright One and Rainbow of Light) was an extremely important figure for the Ayleids, as she was considered the personification of their fourth element, light. The Ayleids often depicted Meridia with wings and a cowl."
 cb8_ideas_4: "Mass Enslavement"
 cb8_ideas_4_desc: "At first enslavement of the Nedic peoples was occasional, but eventually this became a systematic, widespread institution of Ayleid society. They eventually controlled the entirety of modern-day Cyrodiil, and kept the Nedic peoples there enslaved for generations. The Ayleids are also said to have enslaved beastfolk."
 cb8_ideas_5: "Alliance of Kingdoms"
 cb8_ideas_5_desc: "Ayleidic society was an alliance of kingdoms united under one empire, which ultimately ended in 1E 243 with the death of their champion, Umaril the Unfeathered, and the fall of the White-Gold Tower."
 cb8_ideas_6: "Underground Cities"
 cb8_ideas_6_desc: "Their cities were amazing feats of architecture ranging from small settlements to gigantic, labyrinth-like metropolises shaped out of whitish rock. Any enemy shall fear traps and ambushes out of hidden tunnels before engaging proper force weaking the opposition."
 cb8_ideas_7: "Mentors of Men"
 cb8_ideas_7_desc: "Alessia's rebellion coincided with a civil war within the Ayleid Empire which led to many rebel Ayleid lords joining forces with Alessia and aiding her rebellion. These allies of Alessia were largely Aedra-worshippers, indicating that the schism among the Ayleids was likely related to religious differences. Ayleids who remained in Cyrodiil served as mentors and tutors for the new human nobility and many Ayleid nobles remained in power in the new empire of 'men' until the rise of Allesian Order."

 ayl_ideas_1: "Aedra-Daedra Schism"
 ayl_ideas_1_desc: "Alessia's rebellion coincided with a civil war within the Ayleid Empire which led to many rebel Ayleid lords joining forces with Alessia and aiding her rebellion. These allies of Alessia were largely Aedra-worshippers, indicating that the schism among the Ayleids was likely related to religious differences. Even after the Daedric cults rose to power, many Ayleidic kingdoms continued to honor the Aedra. Many slaves in Cyrodiil became Aedra-worshippers by adopting many of the beliefs of their masters, and it's suspected that Alessia incorporated elven Aedra into her Eight Divines pantheon in order to appease her Ayleid and Ayleid-influenced vassals. Ayleids venerated their ancestors, and Aedra is an Elven word for 'ancestor'."
 ayl_ideas_2: "Elven Supremacy"
 ayl_ideas_2_desc: "Ayleid kingdoms proved to exhibit the worst treatment of their slaves. Various settlements became famous for their particular, elaborate method of torturing their slaves, such as 'Wailing Wheels', 'Gut Gardens", 'Flesh-sculptures', and forced ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs, as well as nighttime 'tiger sport', which involved the immolation of human children."
 ayl_ideas_3: "Ayleid Wells"
 ayl_ideas_3_desc: "They used aetherial fragments which fell from the heavens, particularly meteoric iron, to construct receptacles which are believed to harness energy from starlight. These 'Ayleid Wells' are scattered all over Cyrodiil, and can still be used by mages to replenish their energy."
 ayl_ideas_4: "Stargazing"
 ayl_ideas_4_desc: "Magic was an enormous part of their society. In accordance with High Elf religion, they believed Nirn was composed of four basic elements: earth, water, air, and light (as opposed to the four elements of modern natural philosophy: earth, water, air, and fire). Some of their magic tapped into the power of the weather. The most sublime form was starlight, as the stars were the link between Mundus and Aetherius, while Merid-Nunda worship was linked with veneration of light."
 ayl_ideas_5: "Barsaebic Brethen"
 ayl_ideas_5_desc: "Some of our fellows escaped from Cyrodiil to avoid infighting and civil wars. Let us unite marshes of Bravil and Argonia. Let us be one empire of many kingdoms again."
 ayl_ideas_6: "Meteoric Craftstmanship"
 ayl_ideas_6_desc: "The Ayleids, known for harnessing Aetherial Fragments, used the glass to create artifacts like Welkynd Stones and Varla Stones. The crystals were also used as a source of light in Ayleid settlements, likely due to their abhorrence of fire, which they saw as an impure and primal form of light. Skyshards were believed to be shards of Aetherial magicka that carry the essence of Nirn. They are sometimes linked to Lorkhan or Anu. When properly cultivated, meteoric glass crystals are able to grow and multiply."
 ayl_ideas_7: "Umaril the Unfeathered"
 ayl_ideas_7_desc: "Umaril the Unfeathered was an Ayleid sorcerer-king who once ruled Tamriel and enslaved the human population. Umaril was a 'half-Elf', born of an Ayleid mother and a divine father. Using magic, Umaril bound his soul directly to the realm of his mistress Meridia, allowing his spirit to escape death and his physical body to travel between realms. Thus, Umaril would 'never know death'. Umaril was defeated by Pelinal Whitestrake at the start of the First Era during the human uprising against the Ayleids, their 'Slavemasters', and the fall of the White-Gold Tower. While Umaril escaped death, he was cast adrift in the 'waters of Oblivion', and many thousands of years passed before he could return to Mundus. His return at the end of the Third Era was to seek vengeance upon the Divines who had brought about his fall. Aurorans under his command desecrated the chapel of Dibella in Anvil, and later the chapel of Mara in Bravil."
