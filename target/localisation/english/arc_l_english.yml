 arc.0.desc: "Taleskan is in turmoil after the assassination of King Ahmur At-Taleskan. Four factions are vying for control of the kingdom, each with their own vision for the future of Taleskan.\n\nKhud At-Taleskan is a skilled leader and warrior who claims to be the rightful heir to the throne. His supporters believe that he is the best choice to lead Taleskan into a bright future, but critics argue that his legitimacy is in question due to King Ahmur's refusal to acknowledge him as his successor.\n\nDerik Af-Taleskan is a powerful warrior who will stop at nothing to conquer Taleskan. He has brought peace and stability to his own region, but his methods have been criticized as oppressive and tyrannical. Derik's supporters believe that he is the strong leader that Taleskan needs to protect its citizens from attack.\n\nSia Al-Hodana is a well-known merchant and leader of a large mercenary army. He is known for his economic and military savvy, but his critics claim that he is corrupt and only interested in power. Sia's supporters argue that he is a great leader who can handle any situation that arises.\n\nFarsh Aj-Kayam is a charismatic leader and mystic who has rallied the lower class citizens of the city to his cause. He has promised them a better future and has built a cult of followers who believe in his vision for a new Taleskan. Farsh hopes to overthrow the current regime and bring about a religious revolution."

 HLY_startup_text: "\n		The Holly-Frost clan is a proud and resilient group of Nords who have called the northeastern part of Skyrim home for centuries. They have built a reputation for themselves as skilled blacksmiths and weapons craftsmen, producing some of the finest swords, axes, and other weapons in all of Skyrim. Their economy is largely based on this industry, which they trade with other clans and settlements throughout the region.\n\n		Despite the rugged terrain and harsh winters of their homeland, the Holly-Frost clan has managed to thrive and establish a presence in the region, building six holdings in mainland Skyrim and one on Bleakrock Isle. They place a strong emphasis on family and honor, holding regular feasts and festivals to celebrate important events and mark the changing of the seasons.\n\n		Led by a council of elders composed of the heads of each of their six holdings, the Holly-Frost clan has generally maintained peaceful relations with other clans and settlements in Skyrim, though they remain wary of outsiders. They maintain a small but well-trained militia to defend their territory from outside threats, and are skilled in guerrilla warfare and navigating the rugged terrain of the region.	\n"
 SOL_startup_text: "\n		Solitude is a powerful and prosperous hold situated at the mouth of the Karth River, where it meets the Sea of Ghosts. Formed by the merger of three powerful clans during Skyrim's early history, Solitude has grown into a bustling hub of trade and commerce, attracting visitors from across Tamriel. Its strategic location and natural harbor have made it an important center of naval activity, with ships coming and going from all corners of the continent.\n\n		The people of Solitude are proud and loyal to their Jarl, Ulfgar Fog-Eye, who is known for his wise leadership and skilled administration. He and his council of advisors oversee the day-to-day affairs of the hold, working to maintain peace and prosperity among the various clans and settlements that make up the region.\n\n		Despite its many strengths, Solitude is not without its challenges. The hold has a long and complex history, with tensions between the clans often simmering just below the surface. The people of Solitude are tough and resilient, however, and are confident that their Jarl and his family will guide them through any trials that come their way.\n"

His supporters believe that he is the best choice to lead Taleskan into a bright future, but critics argue that his legitimacy is in question due to King Ahmur's refusal to acknowledge him as his successor.\n\nDerik Af-Taleskan is a powerful warrior who will stop at nothing to conquer Taleskan. He has brought peace and stability to his own region, but his methods have been criticized as oppressive and tyrannical. Derik's supporters believe that he is the strong leader that Taleskan needs to protect its citizens from attack.\n\nSia Al-Hodana is a well-known merchant and leader of a large mercenary army. He is known for his economic and military savvy, but his critics claim that he is corrupt and only interested in power. Sia's supporters argue that he is a great leader who can handle any situation that arises.\n\nFarsh Aj-Kayam is a charismatic leader and mystic who has rallied the lower class citizens of the city to his cause. He has promised them a better future and has built a cult of followers who believe in his vision for a new Taleskan. Farsh hopes to overthrow the current regime and bring about a religious revolution.\n\nAs the civil war rages on, it remains to be seen which faction will emerge victorious and shape the future of Taleskan."
