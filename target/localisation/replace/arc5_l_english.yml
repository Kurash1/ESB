 corruption_event.1.title: "The Honest Merchants of [Root.GetName]"
 corruption_event.1.desc: "While many traders are known for cheating countrymen and foreigners alike, lying about the quality of goods and making fraudulent promises, [Root.GetAdjective] merchants are well known to be trustworthy, if competitive. Although they may sometimes cut deals that benefit themselves and not their trade partners, they rarely lie or take bribes. This has made us the first choice of traders around the world."
 corruption_event.1.1: "Why would we lie when we have the best offers?"
 corruption_event.10.title: "Corrupt Ambassador"
 corruption_event.10.desc: "Our representatives to other countries should represent our very best people, but unfortunately, this is not always the case. Sometimes people are given posts as ambassadors because the administration wants them far away, and at worst, there is good reason for this.\n\nAs it turns out, one such ambassador has spent his well-paid exile further enriching himself with bribes. While this is not exactly improving our reputation with the locals, he has maintained important connections here at home and will not be dismissed without causing some trouble."
 corruption_event.10.1: "He has caused more trouble where he is. Get rid of him."
 corruption_event.10.2: "They'll have to get used to it."
 corruption_event.11.title: "[trade_goods_province.GetTradeGoodsName] 'Disappearing'"
 corruption_event.11.desc: "With corruption ever on the rise in [Root.GetName], an increasing amount of [trade_goods_province.GetTradeGoodsName] has been disappearing from our legitimate trade networks onto the black market. While some blame too restrictive regulations and tariffs, part of the problem is clearly that these crimes are simply too easy to get away with. When silence is easily bought, secrets are easy to keep, and those secrets are growing more and more costly for [Root.GetName]."
 corruption_event.11.1: "We must regain control of the [trade_goods_province.GetTradeGoodsName] market."
 corruption_event.12.title: "Corrupt Generals"
 corruption_event.12.desc: "Military experience and expertise should be the main, if not only, factors influencing who rises through the ranks of the [Root.GetAdjective] army. As our society grew more and more corrupt, practices drew further and further away from this ideal. The reality today is that a position as general carries a lot of prestige, and those with money or connections are more than willing to use them to secure such a position. With the existing leadership being easily influenced with these tools, they can.\n\nFrom time to time, someone may rise through the ranks who have actually earned their title, but many of the finest minds in strategic matters will never have a chance to lend their skills to us."
 corruption_event.12.1: "Such an unjust world."
 corruption_event.13.title: "Corrupt Admirals"
 corruption_event.13.desc: "Those who command our ships in battle or are sent to explore lands to be claimed by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should be chosen from the bravest and wisest in our navy. This is not the case today. From their very first day on a ship, sailors see money illicitly changing hands and protocol being broken as a matter of course, and quickly learn that both the letter and the spirit of the law carry little weight in [Root.GetName] when silver is put on the other pan of the scales.\n\nThose who do not learn quickly make enemies. To advance through the ranks of the [Root.GetAdjective] navy, you need to learn to play this system, and those who rise to the top are rarely those we wished would be there."
 corruption_event.13.1: "No wonder we have mutinies."
 corruption_event.14.title: "Foreign Merchants Distrust Us"
 corruption_event.14.desc: "Every trader tries to cut a deal that will be to their benefit, and many are willing to bend the truth a little to succeed. While this is expected, merchants from [Root.GetName] have a reputation abroad that goes beyond this into outright lies and fraud. The corruption which has become a part of how we do business can be shocking to outsiders, which has led to traders worldwide choosing to avoid us when possible.\n\nIt's too late to do anything about our present image, as the damage is already done, but perhaps we can stop this from reoccurring if we stamp out the casual corruption in our society."
 corruption_event.14.1: "We're not dishonest, just pragmatic!"
 corruption_event.15.title: "Governmental Functions Breaking Down"
 corruption_event.15.desc: "A corrupt administration operates less to sustain itself and more to sustain its members. Consequently, as it begins to fall apart, the immediate reaction of most officials is not to save what they all stand to lose, but to grab what they can while it lasts.\n\n[Root.GetName] may not be on its way to a complete collapse, but the severe corruption reaching all the way from the lowest clerk to those closest to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has corroded several crucial governmental functions, leading to a widespread destabilization of the country. This has been a long time coming and we all pay the price."
 corruption_event.15.1: "This cannot be allowed to continue."
 corruption_event.16.title: "Mercenaries Extorting Locals"
 corruption_event.16.desc: "During wartime, soldiers of fortune often find ways to make it home with a bit more than they are paid by raiding the land where they are sent to fight. Normally, this is not a problem for us when they are sent abroad to terrorize our enemies, but sometimes this habit is hard to break, even during peacetime. Some farmers and travelers in [hired_mercs_victim_area.GetAreaName] have complained that the [hired_merc_band.GetName], a mercenary band in our employ stationed there, have been robbing and extorting them, despite - or perhaps because of - the fact that there isn't even a war ongoing.\n\nMeddling in the ranks of mercenaries, even ones that we hired, is always a difficult matter. Their accusers are unlikely to take the matter further if we let it slide, but the question remains as to how our society will change if we allow such extortion to continue."
 corruption_event.16.1: "Purge the mercenary ranks of such thugs."
 corruption_event.16.2: "It's part of the price our country pays for their service."
 corruption_event.17.title: "Incompetent Administrator"
 corruption_event.17.desc: "Matters of governmental organization have never been [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s strong suit. What a good leader does to compensate for such a known weakness is to delegate and this is exactly what our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has done, but the people who have handled administration in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stead have proven to be more competent than honest. The government runs well enough, but tends to slowly shift its priorities towards matters which the benefactors of these irreplaceable officials find to be of importance.\n\nWith [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] unable to fully grasp the intricacies of the matters in question, the guilty parties cannot easily be seen or removed from office. For now, we'll simply have to suffer the consequences."
 corruption_event.17.1: "Unfortunate that skill and honor do not always go hand in hand."
 corruption_event.18.title: "Overextension Exploited"
 corruption_event.18.desc: "The rapid expansion of the [Root.GetAdjective] borders is most fortunate, but brings with it new administrative challenges. As every person familiar with the optimistic language knows, 'challenges' is the sweeter-tasting word for 'problems'. Our country has not fully adjusted to its new extent yet, and people who have noticed the confusion and poorly enforced law in these new acquisitions are reaping the benefits.\n\nThis lawlessness may eventually pass, but the temporary administrations appear to have built an unstable foundation for the future. It will take time and money to rid our society of the distrust forming in the present situation."
 corruption_event.18.1: "We'll have to adapt as best we can."
 corruption_event.19.title: "$TRADER$ Has Corrupt Connections"
 corruption_event.19.desc: "We try to keep our administration free of dishonest individuals, but we cannot always account for the friends and contacts which got them to where they are. $TRADER$ has unfortunately turned out to be a good example of the problems that follow from this, being skilled and personable but somewhat gullible in $TRADER_POSS_PRONOUN$ choice of associates.\n\nRecent investigations have revealed that much of our well-built trade network relies on bribes, smuggling, and other dubious activities to reach its current level of efficiency. $TRADER$ claims to have known nothing of this, which is likely true. Nevertheless, if we decide to expose and end this, the responsibility will be $TRADER_POSS_PRONOUN$ to take."
 corruption_event.19.1: "Failure to see through lies is also a failure."
 corruption_event.19.2: "If it works, it works."
 corruption_event.2.title: "Trust Your Neighbor"
 corruption_event.2.desc: "Although citizens are encouraged to show trust and good faith in their exchanges, the reality in many nations is that it's a risk people cannot afford to take. This, however, is not the case in [Root.GetName]. We have successfully stamped out corruption on so many levels in society, people not only trust officials to do their jobs without the extra help of a bribe but they also trust each other more in general exchanges. This general belief in the honesty of others is the very thread from which the fabric of society is woven, and our country is a shining example of it."
 corruption_event.2.1: "As stipulated in [Root.Religion.GetName] teachings."
 corruption_event.20.title: "Bribes Growing More Accepted"
 corruption_event.20.desc: "'What is the difference between an honest man and a fool? The fool doesn't know he is being swindled.'\n\nSo goes an increasingly common saying in [Root.GetName], the spirit of which is proven through a more sinister change in the social fabric. Bribes are beginning to be seen as a natural consequence of the market, where any action carries a price. Those who refuse to take bribes are viewed as precisely what the saying suggests: fools. Worse than fools, since they are deliberately refusing money that could be theirs. The consequence of this cynicism is that any form of power truly corrupts, and no one who believes it is immune. Not even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 corruption_event.20.1: "It's still just a saying."
 corruption_event.21.title: "A Master Thief Appears"
 corruption_event.21.desc: "Rumors are circulating throughout our realm about the sudden appearance of a legendary master thief. Tales of their incredible feats of larceny and their ability to evade capture have captivated the populace. While some believe these stories are mere exaggerations, others are convinced that a master thief truly walks among us."
 corruption_event.21.1: "It's still just a saying."
 corruption_event.3.title: "Rigorous Researchers"
 corruption_event.3.desc: "Academic institutions are not immune to corruption, and the profits that can be made by abusing positions of great influence can stand in the way of creating a good environment for research. However, [Root.GetAdjective] scientists are largely above this, focusing on genuine intellectual achievements above titles and financial contributions. The lack of corruption in society allows us to explore and invent without being impeded by selfish interests."
 corruption_event.3.1: "The search for knowledge must be valued in itself."
 corruption_event.4.title: "An Honorable People"
 corruption_event.4.desc: "Few are the countries in the world who do not claim to value honor and justice, but even fewer are the countries who actually live up to these ideals. However, the lack of large-scale and everyday corruption in [Root.GetName] has made it one of these rare places where principles matter over personal gain. Even abroad, [Root.GetAdjective] expatriates are sought-after for positions of trust, as our people are known for adherence to duty and rejecting attempted bribes. Who else can claim to live up to these ideals?"
 corruption_event.4.1: "Few indeed."
 corruption_event.5.title: "Incorruptible"
 corruption_event.5.desc: "Not everyone who aids the enemy knows the true nature of their transgression. Spies may be loyal to a foreign power, but many of their information sources are people who are simply paid well for telling secrets they shouldn't, without understanding who makes use of them. However, in [Root.GetName], corruption has been all but extinguished. Spies who recently tried to compromise our administration through bribery and extortion have found themselves reported instead of aided by our officials, and are now at our mercy."
 corruption_event.5.1: "Death to spies!"
 corruption_event.6.title: "Corrupt Taxmen"
 corruption_event.6.desc: "Those who handle large sums of money have always been tempted to claim more than their share of it, and tax collectors are no exception. However, while money getting lost along the way may be a price we can afford to pay, affluent citizens have now found that they can avoid some taxes altogether by paying large bribes to taxmen instead. Currently this seems to be a scheme supported by some of the older collectors trying to retire comfortably. While it is costly, we might be able to avoid spending time and effort on a detailed investigation and just wait it out."
 corruption_event.6.1: "Investigate and replace them immediately."
 corruption_event.6.2: "Let them retire, they've served us well in the past."
 corruption_event.7.title: "Corrupt Advisor"
 corruption_event.7.desc: "[Root.GetName] may be plagued by corruption, but we try to ensure that those closest to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can be trusted, at the very least. Try and fail, it seems, since one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors, [Root.GetEventAdvisorName], was recently caught taking large bribes from people already wielding great influence in our country to provide the government with advice slanted to advance their interests. How shall we respond to this betrayal?"
 corruption_event.7.1: "Publicly expose these lies and prepare an execution."
 corruption_event.7.2: "Arrange for a quiet retirement in house arrest."
 corruption_event.7.3: "A reprimand. Biased advice is still advice."
 corruption_event.8.title: "Wily Smugglers"
 corruption_event.8.desc: "Smuggling is an activity even the most simple-minded can decide to pursue - the only difference is that they get caught. More worrying are those with genuine talent in knowing who to bribe and what lies to tell to elude capture, and as smuggling becomes more profitable, these tend to grow in numbers.\n\nWe have been on the trail of a particularly clever band of smugglers recently, and the network of deceit they have managed to create to continue their operations continues to surprise us. How should we go about resolving this?"
 corruption_event.8.1: "Send our best men to track down their collaborators."
 corruption_event.8.2: "Send an agent to recruit them as spies."
 corruption_event.8.3: "Ignore them for the time being."
 corruption_event.9.title: "[culture_province.Culture.GetName] Community Distrusts Us"
 corruption_event.9.desc: "[Root.GetName] may not house the most egregious liars and traitors in the world, but compared to some other countries, our people do tend to be a bit more easily bribed into abusing their authority. Most of the [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] population accepts the difficulties and, to the dishonest, occasional benefits this brings.\n\nThe [culture_province.Culture.GetName] people in [culture_province.GetName] see things differently. They lament this state of things as a consequence of letting the easily corrupted [Root.Culture.GetName] people rule the nation, claiming that the country ruled by their own people doesn't suffer the same fate. Some of them are suggesting that they would be better off seceding."
 corruption_event.9.1: "Apologize for our failure and promise to improve."
 corruption_event.9.2: "Reject this as uneducated prejudice."

 sailor_event.1.title: "The Vast and Endless Sea"
 sailor_event.1.desc: "Unlike the calling to the battlefields of land, a matter of duty and search for glory, the sea calls to many free spirits who care little for such things. Stories of sailing the oceans of the world and the past expeditions of the [Root.GetAdjective] fleet are retold by old sailors as adventures, many of the great sights remembered, many of the great sacrifices forgotten.\n\nIs it any wonder, with such a legacy, that the youths of [Root.GetName] yearn for the vastness of the sea? Many more have come to join our navy over the past year. Some may end their lives at the bottom of the ocean, but those who return are sure to keep the stories alive."
 sailor_event.1.1: "We write the legacy that inspires future generations."
 sailor_event.2.title: "Harsh Life on the Ocean"
 sailor_event.2.desc: "Many join the ranks of our navy expecting a more exciting life awaiting them with this opportunity to leave their home behind and see sea and land beyond the [Root.GetAdjective] borders. Not all of these are prepared for an often harsh and even more often dull and boring life at sea. Stuck with endlessly repetitive tasks, food and company on longer journeys, many young sailors quickly regret their decision.\n\nDismissed as daydreaming landlubbers by their more seasoned crewmates, they quickly become more trouble than they're worth. Some might eventually grow used to the reality of the job and become useful, but others do more good returning home."
 sailor_event.2.1: "Recruitment propaganda has its downsides."
 sailor_event.3.title: "Sailors Rally to Aid Army"
 sailor_event.3.desc: "Our army has endured severe casualties over the past years, with thousands of lives lost in battle. Meanwhile, those who serve [Root.GetName] at sea have not suffered the same fate. Despite the sacrifices they've made to protect our nation, the ranks of our navy do not lack for hands on deck.\n\nAs a result, the navy has begun to encourage those willing to risk their life at sea to aid our ailing land troops instead. After all, if there's no one to protect our ports, even our best ships and crews will have nowhere to dock."
 sailor_event.3.1: "New recruits must go where they are needed."
 sailor_event.4.title: "Soldiers Rally to Aid Navy"
 sailor_event.4.desc: "In recent conflicts, many lives have been lost at sea. While our army has recovered well, captains find it difficult to recruit crews for [Root.GetAdjective] ships, and many bitter tales have been told all the way up to the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName] about the sacrifices our navy made.\n\nIncreasingly, army leaders have paid heed to this, encouraging those who could have served within their ranks to travel to the coast and man our ships instead. Although they may have much yet to learn, their help will be needed for the navy to recover."
 sailor_event.4.1: "New recruits must go where they are needed."
 sailor_event.5.title: "A Path to the Sea"
 sailor_event.5.desc: "Although [Root.GetName] does not have the seafaring culture of many coastal nations, we nevertheless take pride in the short strip of land that provides us with access to the sea. The [Root.GetAdjective] coast provides many opportunities and draws many hopeful young visitors looking for a new life.\n    \n    Although our naval capacity is limited, having more young people with experience in boatmanship would bolster the crews of our ships. Perhaps we could help these sailor hopefuls to settle in their new home?"
 sailor_event.5.1: "Their ambitions should be encouraged."
 sailor_event.5.2: "They'll grow tired with the sea soon enough."

The energies created by those storms were capable of instantly killing many people or transforming them into near-mindless shells known as harrowed, although others become feral vampires known as harrowfiends, but some who were in the vicinity of the storms were not always affected. The use of the ritual fetishes and alchemy needed to summon harrowstorms is known as harrowcraft."
 esb_weathermagic_5: "Storm Magic"
 esb_weathermagic_5_desc: "The Maormer have many methods of using storm magic to obliterate their foes. They can whip up hurricanes with the intent to destroy entire fleets. They can do so with a ritual using serpent-shaped storm totems to siphon life energy from sacrifices marked with runes. Blood sacrifices such as these are only utilized when a summoner needs to rapidly accrue and release a lot of energy. The energy from the totems can be used to form powerful hurricanes."

 eastmarch_ideas_1: "City of Kings"
 eastmarch_ideas_1_desc: "Windhelm, the City of Kings is a city in northeastern Skyrim, close to the border with Morrowind, and is the only substantial city in the Hold of Eastmarch. It is not only the oldest extant city in Skyrim, but it does hold the tile of being the oldest continuously inhabited human settlement in Tamriel. Windhelm was once the capital of the First Empire of the Nords and the old palace of the Ysgramor dynasty, the Palace of the Kings, still stands in the center of the city."
 eastmarch_ideas_2: "Oldest Hold"
 eastmarch_ideas_2_desc: "Eastmarch is the eastern hold of Skyrim, and one of the four known collectively as the Old Holds. As its name suggests, it lies against the province's eastern border, close to the Dunmeth Pass, the only passage to and from Morrowind in the area due to the high and rugged Velothi Mountains."
 eastmarch_ideas_3: "Home of the High King"
 eastmarch_ideas_3_desc: "Ysgramor's descendants would rule the burgeoning territory of the Nords from Windhelm. When Harald assumed the mantle of High King in 1E 143, he relinquished his holdings in Atmora and established Skyrim as an independent kingdom with Windhelm as its capital."
 eastmarch_ideas_4: "Ysgramoors Legacy"
 eastmarch_ideas_4_desc: "Windhelm was founded by the legendary Ysgramor and the crew of his ship, the Ylgermet, following the Battle of the Moesring in the late Merethic Era. According to Nordic tradition, after the Five Hundred Companions disbanded, the Ylgermet's crew stumbled upon the barrow of Yngol, Ysgramor's son. When Ysgramor looked south and saw where the White River flowed into the Sea of Ghosts, he decreed that a great city should be built there to serve as a monument to the glories of mankind, a place from where he could gaze upon the hill of Yngol's barrow, and a gateway to guard Skyrim's interior against incursion via the river."
 eastmarch_ideas_5: "Wuunding"
 eastmarch_ideas_5_desc: "According to legend, the hot springs of Eastmarch were created when the hero Wuunding fought a mighty Daedra and defeated it with a flaming hammer. The hammer's blows melted the Daedra, leaving behind the numerous hot springs."
 eastmarch_ideas_6: "White River Exit"
 eastmarch_ideas_6_desc: "The city's great bridge was designed to allow a vigilant watch on the White River for elven attacks, and Ysgramor's palace, the Palace of the Kings, towered over the city to show man's dominion over the very winds that had caused Yngol's death on the voyage from Atmora."
 eastmarch_ideas_7: "Yngol Barrow"
 eastmarch_ideas_7_desc: "During a trip across the Sea of Ghosts, Ysgramor and the Five Hundred Companions were caught in a terrible storm which caused the loss of both Yngol and the crew of the Harakh. When Ysgramor claimed his son's body he had it buried in the Atmoran barrow-hill tradition near where the White River met the Sea of Ghosts. After the disbanding of the Five Hundred Companions, Ysgramor would reencounter Yngol Barrow and decreed that a great city should be built near by in order that he have a view of the barrow from his seat of power."

 orc_ideas_1: "Gift of Strength"
 orc_ideas_1_desc: "'No one bests an Orc!'\nCompared to the other races of Tamriel, Orcs are blessed with a towering physique and fearsome strength."
 orc_ideas_2: "Orcish Smithing"
 orc_ideas_2_desc: "Orichalcum (also called Orichalc) is a greyish-green metal used primarily to make weapons and armour. Orcs are famed for their use of this metal, with some comparing its qualities to the Orcs themselves - green, exceptionally rigid, stronger than steel, and extremely temperamental"
 orc_ideas_3: "Mauloch, the Orc-Father"
 orc_ideas_3_desc: "God of curses, hear my prayer!\nLord of the betrayed, give me strength!\nKeeper of the grudge, harden my heart!\nHolder of the broken promises, ignite my anguish!\nMaster of the sworn oath, grant me the ferocity to overcome my enemies!\nMalacath, hear my prayer!\n— Prayer to the Furious One"
 orc_ideas_4: "A Diamond in the Rough"
 orc_ideas_4_desc: "It is true that Orcs highly value 'brutish' qualities like strength and prowess in combat, but what is often forgotten is their capacity for gentleness and an appreciation of what little beauty their lives of hardship allow for."
 orc_ideas_5: "Orcish Industry"
 orc_ideas_5_desc: "Partially owning to their innate skill as smiths and metalworkers, and partially to their propensity for settling in mineral-rich mountainous areas, Orcs are unrivalled in their ability to produce quality manufactured goods."
 orc_ideas_6: "Warrior Society"
 orc_ideas_6_desc: "All Orcs - both male and female - are expected to know how to fight in order to defend their homeland from the outsiders who would dare try to take away their sovereignty."
 orc_ideas_7: "The Tilted Square"
 orc_ideas_7_desc: "The Tilted Square was a philosophical amalgamation of the teachings of Malacath with their representations as sacred geometric shapes. Embedded in the concept of the Titled Square are notions of stability and trust, juxtaposed with their counterparts - instability and betrayal."

 reachmen_ideas_start: "Reachmen Traditions"
 reachmen_ideas_1: "The Reach"
 reachmen_ideas_1_desc: "Even the neighbouring Bretons, Nords, and Orcs - themselves no stranger to tough terrain - consider the Reach a wild and inhospitable place to call home. Jagged cliffs, narrow canyons, raging rapids, and plunging waterfalls make up some of its rugged terrains, leaving precious-little room for agriculture and husbandry. As such, the Reachmen are forced to eke out a living by working what little land is available, as well as by herding, hunting, gathering, and trading."
 reachmen_ideas_2: "A Proud People"
 reachmen_ideas_2_desc: "Reachmen society is based around a system of clans and kinship, and above all, a fierce desire to live free and independent of outside rule."
 reachmen_ideas_3: "The Hunt-Father"
 reachmen_ideas_3_desc: "The Hunt-Father, more commonly known as Hircine to outsiders, is the foremost spirit in Reachmen society. His veneration is critical to ensuring the success of their hunts - one of the few sources of food available in the Reach."
 reachmen_ideas_4: "Great Chieftains"
 reachmen_ideas_4_desc: "Reachmen society greatly values warriors brave of heart, and strong in the arm. In difficult times, such a hero sometimes emerges to lead the Reachmen through their tribulations, and re-assert their place in the Reach."
 reachmen_ideas_5: "Redoubts"
 reachmen_ideas_5_desc: "The nature of the terrain of the Reach means that certain areas require very little additional fortification to achieve a high degree of defensibility."
 reachmen_ideas_6: "The Longhouse Emperors"
 reachmen_ideas_6_desc: "The Longhouse Emperors were a dynasty of Reachmen of managed to capture and rule the Empire for a period of time during the interregnum."
 reachmen_ideas_7: "Silver Deposits"

 snow_elven_ideas_1: "Aptitude for Magick"
 snow_elven_ideas_1_desc: "While all Mer have an enhanced affinity for the arcane arts, the abilities of the Snow Elves are thought to match, or potentially even exceed, those of their Altmer cousins."
 snow_elven_ideas_2: "Homeland of Snow"
 snow_elven_ideas_2_desc: "Snow Elves are said to have adapted to the cold climate of their homeland in Skyrim so well, that the cold and ice no longer had any effect on them at all."
 snow_elven_ideas_3: "Auri-El Almighty"
 snow_elven_ideas_3_desc: "Auri-El is the undisputed chief deity in Snow Elf theology. Though they share their pantheon with their Altmer cousins, only the Snow Elves venerate Auri-El to such extreme lengths."
 snow_elven_ideas_4: "Monuments of Stone"
 snow_elven_ideas_4_desc: "The Snow Elves left behind many imposing structures and monuments. Even long after their heyday in the Merethic Era, the Snow Elves were able to build impressive structures like the Chantry of Auri-El and the Great Statue of Irkngthand."
 snow_elven_ideas_5: "The Way of the Pilgrim"
 snow_elven_ideas_5_desc: "Snow Elves wishing to prove their devotion would occasionally make pilgrimages to holy sites dedicated to their gods; in particular the Great Chantry of Auri-El in the Forgotten Vale. These pilgrims would follow an arduous path that required them to tap into their deepest reserves of strength and determination in order to complete it. On the way, they visit wayshrines where they learn esoteric mantras that will aid them in their quest for enlightenment."
 snow_elven_ideas_6: "Skilled Botanists"
 snow_elven_ideas_6_desc: "The Snow-Cedar, which can grow in harsh environments such as the heart of a frozen glacier, is the result of decades of careful selective breeding by the Snow Elves. Such botanical skill allows the Snow Elves to prosper even in the harshest of environments."
 snow_elven_ideas_7: "Chantries and Wayshrines"
 snow_elven_ideas_7_desc: "Snow elves are known to build Chantries - special religious centres which are dedicated to an individual. A famous chantry called the Great Chantry of Auri-El is known to exist in the Forgotten Vale, nestled in the Druadach Mountains. Snow-elf pilgrims would journey between special wayshrines on their way up to the chantry to do penance or fulfil other religious obligations. These establishments became key places of refuge for the few Snow Elves who somehow evaded the axes of the Nords and the chains of the Dwemer."

 nordic_ideas_3: "Arctic Homeland"
 nordic_ideas_3_desc: "Skyrim, the home of the Nords, is a harsh land with soaring peaks, icy rivers, and frozen tundra. Anyone who deigns to live there must be of a certain sturdy stock, and woe to the outsider who is unaccustomed to the brutal climate."
 nordic_ideas_4: "Kyne, Goddess of the Storm"
 nordic_ideas_4_desc: "Kyne is the chief deity of the Nordic Pantheon. She is associated with the wind and rain - be it a summer's breeze or a spring shower, or a terrible storm that leaves destruction in its wake."
 nordic_ideas_5: "Mead Halls"
 nordic_ideas_5_desc: "The mead hall is a cornerstone of Nordic culture; A place to warm up, get drunk and listen to stories of the great heroes of old."
 nordic_ideas_6: "Ysgramor's Fleet"
 nordic_ideas_6_desc: "Late in the Merethic Era, the hero Ysgramor led a contingent of Atmorans - the fabled Five-Hundred Companions - to exact revenge on the elves who slaughtered his kin, and to build a new home on the Tamriel mainland. His fleet consisted of infamous ships like the Jorrvaskr, the Fallowfire, and the Ylgermet, and their equally infamous crews and captains. These heroes of yore built a kingdom on top of Elven corpses, and laid the foundations of Skyrim as it is known today."
 nordic_ideas_7: "Sovngarde"
