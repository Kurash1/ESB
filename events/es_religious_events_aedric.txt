# es_religious_events_aedric.10.d: "For a long time, we have not held any celebrations in [Root.Capital.GetName] for the upper class, who work day and night for the good of our nation, being an indispensable pillar for the $MONARCH$. Therefore, in order not to lose this pillar, a feast will soon be held in the palace of the $MONARCHTITLE$, to which all influential landowners, merchants and warlords will be invited. Of course, in order to feed so many people, we will have to slaughter a lot of livestock, thankfully there are enough farms in our district. Though, some councillors think we should have a more modest feast, for killing so many animals at once might incur the wrath of Ius. However, on the other hand, if we believe in these superstitions and decide not to invite merchants or the warlords, it may complicate our relations with them in the future."

	# The Land Where We Live
	# Much of Elsweyr is occupied by savannahs, badlands and dry plains, making life in this region hard and farming possible only near the Tenmar Forest and Quin'rawl Peninsula, where ertile lands of jungle and rainforests begin to dominate the sand dunes. However, this was far from always the case. Once upon a time there was a sea in the middle of Elsweyr, washing the shores of Orcrest, The Stitches and Merryvale, the climate was mild and pleasant and farming was possible all year round. Back then the Khajiits were still children of Nirni, daughter of Fadomai and the mother of all mortal life in the Mundus, when Azura took them and turned them into the first Khajiits to make them secret protectors of the World. In response to the change of their shapes, Nirni punished the Khajiit by making their lands arid and barren, draining the ancient sea, exposing the canyons and depths of the Scar. This was to break the Khajiit, make them beg for forgiveness or leave their ancestral home forever. But the Kajits did neither, and stayed where they belonged, adapting and adapting to the new conditions, growing stronger and learning to survive in the new reality of their lives.
